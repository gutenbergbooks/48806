<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER I<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE BURNEY FAMILY</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'>In the second half of the seventeenth century, there
lived at the village of Great Hanwood, four miles from
Shrewsbury, a country gentleman of a good estate,
named James Macburney. In later life, he was land-steward
to the Earl of Ashburnham; and he rented or
possessed a house in the Privy Garden at Whitehall.
Tradition traces his family to Scotland, whence it was
said to have arrived with James <span class='sc'>i.</span> However this
may be,—and the point was not regarded as of much
importance by his descendants,—James Macburney
married his Shropshire rector’s daughter; begat a son;
and in due time, became a widower. The son—also
James Macburney—was educated at Westminster
School under the redoubtable Dr. Busby. Then, taking
to art, he worked as a pupil of the “eminent Face
Painter,” Michael Dahl. About 1697, at the age of
nineteen, he ran away with Rebecca Ellis, an actress in
Giffard’s Company, and younger than himself. Thereupon
his irate father disinherited him, and in further
token of his displeasure, took to wife his own cook, by
whom he had another son called Joseph, who, as soon
<span class='pageno' title='2' id='Page_2'></span>
as he arrived at man’s estate, removed all possible
difficulties in regard to the succession by dissipating
the property. Having effected this with much promptitude,
he settled down contentedly as a Norfolk
dancing master. Meanwhile, his elder half-brother,—who,
though lacking in discretion, had many pleasing
gifts (he was, in particular, an accomplished violin-player),—being
left, by the death of his actress-wife,
with a numerous family, wedded, for the second
time, a beautiful young lady of Shropshire, Mistress
(<span class='it'>i.e.</span> Miss) Ann Cooper. Miss Cooper was currently
reported to have rejected Wycherley the dramatist,
who, it may be remembered, like the elder Macburney,
was desirous of disappointing his natural heir. Miss
Cooper had some money; but James Macburney’s
second marriage increased the number of his children.
The youngest members of his family were twins,
Susannah (who died early), and Charles, afterwards
the well-known historian of music, and the father of
Fanny Burney. Like his predecessors, he was born
Macburney, but the “Mac” was subsequently dropped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not long after Charles Burney’s birth, which took
place on the 12th April 1726, in Raven Street, Shrewsbury
(a name probably derived from the famous Raven
Inn once familiar to Farquhar and “Serjeant Kite”),
James Burney, as we may now call his father, settled
at Chester as a portrait painter, leaving his little son
at nurse in Condover, a village near Shrewsbury.
Here, with an affectionate foster mother, Charles
Burney throve apace, until he was transferred to the
Chester Grammar School. At this date his natural
gifts were sufficiently manifest to enable him at a
pinch to act as deputy for the Cathedral organist.
<span class='pageno' title='3' id='Page_3'></span>
Subsequently, he became the pupil of his half-brother,
James, the organist of St. Mary’s Church at Shrewsbury.
Then, being again in Chester when the famous Dr.
Augustine Arne was passing through the town on his
return from Ireland to London, he was fortunate
enough to be taken as that master’s apprentice. This
was in August 1744, when he was eighteen, pleasant-mannered,
intelligent, very musical, very versatile, and—as
he continued to be through life—an indefatigable
worker. From Arne he did not learn much except
to copy music, and to drudge in the Drury Lane
Orchestra, which Arne conducted; and, although he
had an elder brother in London, he was left greatly to
his own devices. But his abilities and personal charm
brought him many friends. He was frequently at
the house in Scotland Yard of Arne’s sister, Mrs.
Cibber, the foremost tragic actress of her day; and
here he made acquaintance with many notabilities.
Handel was often among the visitors, playing intricate
fugues and overtures with his pudgy fingers upon the
harpsichord; and Garrick, with the wonderful eyes;
and Garrick’s surly old rival, the <span class='it'>bon-vivant</span>, James
Quin; and Mason; and Thomson the poet of <span class='it'>The
Seasons</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With Arne, Charles Burney would probably have
remained, but for a fortunate accident. At the shop
of Jacob Kirkman, the German harpsichord maker
in Broad Street, Golden Square, he met Mr. Fulke
Greville, a descendant of Sidney’s friend, the famous
Fulke Greville of Queen Elizabeth’s days. The
Greville of 1746 either possessed, or affected to
possess, many of the attributes of Bramston’s <span class='it'>Man
of Taste</span>:—
<span class='pageno' title='4' id='Page_4'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<div class='literal-container' style=''><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“I would with <span class='it'>Jockeys</span> from <span class='it'>Newmarket</span> dine,</p>
<p class='line0'>And to <span class='it'>Rough-riders</span> give my choicest wine .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p class='line0'>In <span class='it'>Fig</span> the Prize-fighter by day delight,</p>
<p class='line0'>And sup with <span class='it'>Colly Cibber</span> ev’ry night.”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Like Bramston’s hero, he also dabbled in gardening.
But his accomplishments were not confined to pugilism
and field sports. He danced, fenced, drew, wrote
verses, and trifled with metaphysics. Lastly, he “<span class='it'>had</span>
an ear.” After the fashion of his day, he had doubted
whether any musician could possibly be a gentleman,
but Charles Burney undeceived him. The result was
that Greville paid three hundred pounds to cancel
Burney’s engagement to Arne, and attached his new
friend to his own establishment in the capacity of
musical companion. This curious conjunction, which
seems to have included a fair experience of Greville’s
other diversions, did no harm to Charles Burney. On
the contrary, at Greville’s country seat of Wilbury
House in Wiltshire, he met many interesting and some
eminent people, who considerably enlarged his social
aptitudes. In 1747, however, his patron married a
Miss Frances Macartney,—the “Flora” of Horace
Walpole’s <span class='it'>Beauties</span>,—making, in his impatience of the
conventional,—or <span class='it'>fogrum</span> as it was then styled,—a
perfectly superfluous stolen match. “Mr. Greville”—said
the lady’s matter-of-fact father, when his pardon
and blessing were formally requested—“has chosen to
take a wife out of the window, whom he might just as
well have taken out of the door.” Burney gave away
the bride; and after standing proxy for a duke at the
baptism of the first child,<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> would have accompanied
<span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span>
the Grevilles to Italy. But at this juncture he discovered
that he, too, had an affair of the heart. Thereupon
Mr. Greville magnanimously released him from
his engagement, and left him to marry the woman of
his choice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was a Miss Esther Sleepe, very attractive and
very amiable. Her mother, although of Huguenot
origin, was a Roman Catholic. Esther herself was a
Protestant. She married Charles Burney about 1748,
and they went to live in the City. In 1749, her
husband was appointed organist of St. Dionis Backchurch,
which had been rebuilt by Wren after the
Great Fire. Burney’s modest salary was £30 per
annum. But he composed music, and soon found many
pupils. When his first child, called Esther after her
mother, was born, is not stated; but the register of
St. Dionis contains record of the birth, in June, 1750,
of James Burney, afterwards an admiral; and, in 1751,
of a son Charles, who, apparently, died early. Before
this date, hard work and close application had begun
to tell upon the father of the little family, and he was
advised by his friend Dr. John Armstrong, the author
of <span class='it'>The Art of Preserving Health</span>, to try living in the
country. He accordingly accepted the post of organist,
with a salary of £100 a year, at St. Margaret’s Church,
King’s Lynn, to which place he removed in 1751, his
wife joining him some months later. At King’s Lynn,
on the 13th June, 1752, was born his second daughter,
Frances, or Fanny Burney, whose life-story forms the
theme of this volume. The name of Frances came to her
from her godmother, Mrs. Greville; and she was baptized
at St. Nicholas, in Ann Street. At Lynn were born
two other children, Susanna, no doubt so named after
<span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'></span>
her father’s twin sister; and a second Charles, later a
famous Greek scholar, Rector of Deptford, and Chaplain
to George <span class='sc'>iii.</span> The date of Susanna’s birth is not
known; but Charles Burney was born in December, 1757.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Lynn, in spite of an execrable instrument, and
an irresponsive audience, the new organist’s health
speedily improved. His hearers, if unmusical, were
not unfriendly, and his own good qualities helped him
as of yore. “He scarcely ever entered a house upon
terms of business, without leaving it upon those of
intimacy.” He gave music lessons in many of the
great Norfolk mansions,—at Houghton (Lord Orford’s),
at Holkham (the home of the Leicesters), at Rainham
(General Lord Townshend’s), and at Felbrigge Park
(Mr. Windham’s),—padding along the sandy crossroads
to his destination upon his sure-footed mare
“Peggy,” with a certainty that permitted him to study
Tasso or Metastasio in the saddle, and even to consult
a dictionary of his own composing which he carried in
his great-coat pocket. These things, added to correspondence
with the Greville circle, projects for a
<span class='it'>History of Music</span>, increasing means, and a pleasant
home, made Lynn life very tolerable for a season. But
towards 1759 he seems to have wearied a little of his
provincial lot, added to which, friends began to counsel
his return to town, and to protest against his exile
among “foggy aldermen.” “Really, among friends,”—wrote
one of them, to whom we shall often refer
hereafter,—“is not settling at Lynn planting your
youth, genius, hopes, fortune, etc., against a north
wall? Can you ever expect ripe, high-flavoured fruit,
from such an aspect?” And then the writer went on
to adjure him to transplant his “spare person,” his
<span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'></span>
“pretty mate,” and his “brats” to the more congenial
environment of the capital. He eventually quitted
Lynn in 1760 for London, which he had left about
nine years before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this date, he was four and thirty. He set up
his tent in Poland Street, then a rather more favoured
place of residence than it is at present, and having,
beyond the Oxford Road (as Oxford Street was then
called), little but open fields and market gardens.
Portman Square, Manchester Square, Russell Square,—of
all these not a stone had been laid.<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a> But Poland
Street was not without aristocratic occupants. The
Duke of Chandos, Sir Willoughby Aston (with whose
daughters the Miss Burneys went to school at Paris),
Lady Augusta Bridges and others were all distinguished
neighbours in this now dingy street—to
say nothing of the Cherokee King, who, when he
visited England, actually, to the delight of the
Burney children, took lodgings “almost immediately
opposite.” At Poland Street Charles Burney rapidly
became the music master most in request with the
fashionable world. Soon he had not an hour of the
day unoccupied, beginning his rounds as early as
seven in the morning, and finishing them, sometimes,
only at eleven at night. Often he dined in a hackney
coach on the contents of a sandwich box and a flask
of sherry and water. But he must still have found
time for original work, since it was at Poland Street
that, besides “Sonatas for the Harpsichord,” he
composed in 1763 the setting for Bonnell Thornton’s
Burlesque <span class='it'>Ode on St. Caecilia’s Day</span>, “adapted to the
Antient British Musick; viz.: the Salt Box, the Jew’s
<span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span>
Harp, the Marrow-Bones and Cleavers, the Hum-Strum
or Hurdy-Gurdy,” and the rest, which was
performed at Ranelagh in masks, to the huge delectation
of an audience musical and unmusical, and the
amusement of Dr. Johnson.<a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a> But the pleasures of
increasing popularity were dashed by domestic misfortune.
Mrs. Burney, the “pretty mate” of the
last paragraph, having, in the new home, given
birth to a fourth daughter, Charlotte, sickened of
consumption. A visit to the Bristol Hot Wells
(Clifton) proved unavailing; and to the intense grief
of her husband and family, she died, after a brief
illness, on the 28th September, 1761. She seems to
have been a most affectionate mother, and sympathised
with her husband in his bookish tastes. With one of
his subsequent essays he published a translation from
Maupertuis, which she, naturally an excellent French
scholar, had executed; and her reading of Pope’s
<span class='it'>Works</span> and the <span class='it'>Virgil</span> of Spence’s friend Christopher
Pitt, was one of the memories of her daughters. But
at the time of her death her eldest child was only
twelve, and her youngest a baby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little family at Poland Street, thus suddenly
<span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span>
left motherless, must have been an exceptionally
interesting one. Esther, or Hetty, the eldest, is
described as extremely beautiful, and possessed of that
fortunate combination, good sense, good humour, and
an abundant love of fun. She was besides remarkably
musical, and according to the <span class='it'>Gentleman’s Magazine</span>,
was wont to astonish her father’s guests, at a very
early age, by her skilful instrumentalism. James, the
eldest son, who, at the age of ten, entered the Navy
under Admiral Montagu as a nominal midshipman,
was an unusually bright and manly lad, full of vivacity
and high spirits. When at school in his Norfolk
home, he had been taught by Eugene Aram. He
could recall how that “melancholy man” would pace
the playground talking of strange deeds to the elder
boys; and he remembered well the memorable night
in August 1758 when</p>

<p class='noindent'>James Burney rose to eminence in his profession,—sailed
twice round the world with Captain Cook, was
with him at his death, and lived to be a fine specimen
of the old-time sailor, cheery and humourous, unpolished
externally, but “gentle and humane” at
heart. Charles Lamb loved him; Southey depicts
him in his Captainhood as “smoking after supper,
and letting out puffs at one corner of his mouth, and
puns at the other”; and he dropped Hazlitt out of
<span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>
his whist parties, to which he was as attached as
Mrs. Battle, because “W. H.” had affronted him by
reviewing his sister Fanny’s <span class='it'>Wanderer</span> severely in
the <span class='it'>Edinburgh</span>. In this brief biography James Burney
cannot often appear hereafter, which must excuse
these anticipations. The third child, Susanna, or, to
be exact, Susanna Elizabeth, was also remarkable for
her sweetness and charm. Joseph Baretti praised her
<span class='it'>dolcissima voce</span>; her knowledge of music was affirmed
to be exact and critical; and her native literary faculty
was as fine, if not as imperative, as that of her sister
Frances. Charles, the second boy, was still in the
nursery; and Charlotte was a baby. Neither of these
last can have had much influence on Frances, who with
Esther, Susanna and James made up the little group
of clever children which delighted Charles Burney’s
friends, from Garrick to the singer Pacchieroti. “All!
<span class='it'>all! very clever girls</span>” (James was of course at sea)—said
this observer later in his queer broken English.
“Sense and <span class='it'>witta</span> (<span class='it'>sic</span>) inhabit <span class='it'>here</span>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. All I meet with
at Dr. Burney’s house are superior to other people.
I am myself the only <span class='it'>Bestia</span> that enters the house.
I am, indeed, <span class='it'>a truly</span> Beast”—by which the poor
gentleman in his humility, as Mrs. Ellis suggests,
obviously intended no more than is conveyed by the
French <span class='it'>bête</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the above enumeration of Charles Burney’s
children, Frances has been intentionally passed over,
and to Frances we now turn. Like many other
persons destined to make their mark in this world,
she does not seem to have impressed it greatly at the
outset. Neither for beauty nor physique was she
notable in childhood; indeed she was both short and
<span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span>
short-sighted. She was besides extremely shy and
silent, as well as backward in most things. At the
age of eight she had not learned to read, and her
sailor brother used often to divert himself by giving
her a book upside down in order to see what she
would make of it. Mrs. Burney’s friends used to call
her the “little dunce”; but her shrewder mother
“had no fear of Fanny.” For it was observed, by
those who looked close, that her perceptive faculties
were exceedingly acute; that, in a quiet way, she
noticed many things; that she was full of humour
and invention in her play; and that whenever she
went with the rest to Mrs. Garrick’s box at Drury
Lane, although she could not read the piece acted,
she was quite capable of mimicking the actors, and
even of putting appropriate speeches into their mouths.
These exhibitions, however, she would only give in
the strictest domestic privacy. Before strangers, she
became at once the demure, reserved, and almost
sheepish little person whom it was the custom to
designate familiarly as “the old lady.” An anecdote
related by her father illustrates some of these peculiarities
of character. Next door to the Burneys in
Poland Street lived a wig-maker who supplied the
voluminous full-bottomed periwigs then favoured by
the gentlemen of the Law. The Burney girls used to
play with the wig-maker’s daughters, and one day the
playmates got access to the wig-magazine. They then
proceeded to array themselves in what Fanny’s later
friend Dr. Hawkesworth calls “the honours of the
head,” dancing about in great delight at their ridiculous
figures. Unfortunately one of the ten-guinea flaxen
masterpieces soused suddenly into a garden tub filled
<span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>
with water, and forthwith losing all its portentous
“Gorgon buckle,” was declared by the manufacturer
to be totally spoilt. “He was extremely angry,”
says Fanny’s father, “and chid very severely his own
children; when my little daughter, the old lady, then
ten years of age [1762], advancing to him, as I was
informed, with great gravity and composure, sedately
says; ‘What signifies talking so much about an
accident? The wig is wet, to be sure; and the wig
was a good wig, to be sure; but it’s of no use to
speak of it any more; because what’s done can’t be
undone.’ ”<a id='r5'/><a href='#f5' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[5]</span></sup></a> Dr. Johnson himself could not have been
more oracular, though he would probably have said
(as indeed he does in <span class='it'>Rasselas</span>)—“What cannot be
repaired is not to be regretted!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this point it becomes necessary to introduce
a personage who, for the future, plays no inconsiderable
part in Frances Burney’s biography. Mention
has been made of a friend by whom Charles Burney
was advised to exchange the north wall of Lynn
for a more congenial London aspect. This was
one Samuel Crisp, a gentleman twenty years older
than Fanny’s father, who had made his acquaintance
when acting as musical companion to Fulke Greville.
Samuel Crisp was a person of some importance in his
day,—a man of taste and fashion, good-looking, well-mannered
and accomplished, having gifts both artistic
and musical,—friendly alike with the Duchess of Portland
and Mrs. Montagu,—with Lady Coventry and
Richard Owen Cambridge, with Quin and Garrick.
Like many of equal abilities, he had dabbled in
literature; and two years after Fanny’s birth, Garrick
<span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span>
had produced at Drury Lane, not without pressure
from the writer’s aristocratic supporters, a tragedy
which Crisp had essayed upon a subject already treated
more than a hundred years before by John Webster,—the
story of Virginia. Crisp’s play cannot be said
to have failed, for it ran for two nights more than
Johnson’s <span class='it'>Irene</span>. But, on the other hand, it was not
a genuine success, although Garrick, besides supplying
an excellent Prologue and Epilogue, himself acted
Virginius to the Virginia of Mrs. Cibber. The truth
is, it was dull,—too dull even to be galvanised into
mock vitality by the energy of the manager. No alterations
could thenceforth persuade Garrick to revive
it, and the author was naturally deeply chagrined.
In a frame of mind very unfriendly to humanity in
general, he carried his mortification to Italy. Returning
in due course somewhat soothed and restored,
he settled at Hampton, furnishing a house there so
lavishly with guests, pictures, bustos and musical
instruments that he speedily began to exhaust his
sources of income. His annoyance at this discovery
being aggravated by gout, in a fit of spleen he sold
his villa by the Thames; and determining to realise
Pope’s “the world forgetting, by the world forgot,”
took sanctuary with a friend in a secluded part of the
country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The retreat he selected was at Chessington, or—as
it was then spelled—Chesington Hall, a rambling and
ruinous old house between Kingston and Epsom. At
this date, though on high ground, it stood in the
middle of a wild and almost trackless common, which
separated it effectually from the passing stranger. Its
owner, Mr. Christopher Hamilton, was an old friend
<span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>
of Crisp and, since the house was too large for his
means, only too pleased to welcome as an inmate,
a companion who would share his expenses. At
Chessington Crisp lived many years, and at Chessington
he was buried. Until he became too infirm, he
quitted it annually for a few weeks every spring,
when he repaired to Town to visit his old haunts,
look in at a concert or two, and run through the
principal picture galleries. Lord Macaulay has described
him as “hiding himself like a wild beast in
a den,” in consequence of the failure of his tragedy,
which—as we have seen—was rather indulgently
received, at all events on the stage.<a id='r6'/><a href='#f6' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[6]</span></sup></a> But Lord
Macaulay had not before him all the information
we have at present. Although Crisp rated his tragic
powers too high, and consequently felt his qualified
success more acutely, it is probable that impaired
health and reduced means had most to do with his
withdrawal to Chessington; and there is no particular
evidence that his seclusion, though strict, was savage.
In one of his periodical visits to London, he happened
upon Burney; came at once to see him at Poland
Street; grew keenly interested in his motherless
children, and thenceforward continued to be the lifelong
ally and adviser of the family. Chessington Hall
became a haven of rest for the Burneys,—“a place of
peace, ease, freedom and cheerfulness,” to which, even
when it was later turned into a boarding-house by
Miss Hamilton, the father retired to work at his books,
and the children for change of air. As Crisp grew older,
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>
they grew more and more necessary to his existence,
filling the dark passages and tapestried chambers of
the old house with fiddles and harpsichords, dancing,
amateur acting, and all the stir and bustle of their
fresh and healthy vitality. Their company must have
been invaluable to a host, contracted, but by no means
wedded, to melancholy; and there is no doubt that in
return his experience of the world, his sterling good
sense, and his educated taste were of the greatest
service to them. They brightened and cheered his
life; but they also owed not a little to the personage
whom, in brief space, they came to designate affectionately
as “Daddy” Crisp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For two or three years after Mrs. Burney’s death
not much is known of her husband’s doings. His grief
at first was intense; but like many sensible men, he
at once sought to mitigate it by hard work, attempting
among other things a prose translation of Dante’s
<span class='it'>Inferno</span>. In June, 1764, he paid a short visit to Paris
in order to place Hetty and Susan at school there.
Fanny was older than Susan, but apart from her
general backwardness, her father seems to have apprehended
that her very emotional character (she had
been overpowered with grief at her mother’s death)
might, when on the Continent, perhaps induce her to
adopt the creed of her grandmother, Mrs. Sleepe, to
whom she was much attached. In the French capital,
Charles Burney found many friends, and under the
influence of Paris air, Paris clothes, Paris festivities
and the <span class='it'>Comédie Italienne</span>, began speedily—like Garrick
in the same place a few months afterwards—to recover
his spirits, and interest himself once more in his old
pursuits. Either now or later, he set to work upon
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>
a version of Rousseau’s musical <span class='it'>intermède</span>, the <span class='it'>Devin du
Village</span>, under the title of <span class='it'>The Cunning Man</span>.<a id='r7'/><a href='#f7' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[7]</span></sup></a> Towards
the end of June, he left Hetty and Susan in the care
of a certain Mme. St. Mart. They remained at Paris
for about two years, returning in 1767.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first diarist of the family appears to have been
Susan Burney, who began her records at the early age
of ten. Soon after her return home she sketched the
portraits of her two elder sisters. “The characteristics
of Hetty seem to be wit, generosity, and openness of
heart:—Fanny’s,—sense, sensibility, and bashfulness,
and even a degree of prudery. Her understanding is
superior, but her diffidence gives her a bashfulness
before company with whom she is not intimate, which
is a disadvantage to her. My eldest sister shines
in conversation, because, though very modest, she is
totally free from any <span class='it'>mauvaise honte</span>: were Fanny
equally so, I am persuaded she would shine no less.
I am afraid that my eldest sister is too communicative,
and that my sister Fanny is too reserved. They are
both charming girls—<span class='it'>des filles comme il y en a peu</span>.”<a id='r8'/><a href='#f8' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[8]</span></sup></a>
The words make one think that the composing of
<span class='it'>Caractères</span> or <span class='it'>Portraits</span> must have formed part of
Mme. St. Mart’s <span class='it'>curriculum</span>. At all events they are
all we know of Frances Burney at this time, and they
coincide with what we have learned already. Doubtless,
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>
during the absence of her sisters in France, she
had been slowly developing. To her busy father, although
he left her much to herself, she was devotedly
attached; and she had grown almost as fond of the
adopted parent who had now become her “guide,
philosopher and friend.” When Hetty and Susan
were away, she probably saw a great deal of Mr. Crisp,
and in the beginning of 1766 paid her first visit to
the “dear, ever dear Chesington” which was to figure
so frequently in her future journals. It had been her
father’s intention that she and her younger sister
Charlotte should also have the advantage of two years’
schooling at Mme. St. Mart’s establishment; but the
project, first postponed, was afterwards abandoned in
consequence of Mr. Burney’s second marriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This took place in October, 1767. The lady,
Elizabeth Allen, was the widow of a wealthy
Lynn wine-merchant. She had been the intimate
friend of the late Mrs. Burney, whose death she had
deplored almost as much as Mrs. Burney’s husband.
She had three children; but, owing to losses in
her widowhood, apparently possessed nothing but a
dower-house in the churchyard of St. Margaret’s at
Lynn. Coming to London for the education of her
eldest daughter, Maria, she renewed her acquaintance
with the Burneys. Handsome, intelligent, well-read,
and something of a blue-stocking to boot, she seems
speedily to have inspired in Mr. Burney an affection
as genuine as her own for him. But as her Lynn
relatives were not likely to approve the match, seeing
particularly that Mr. Burney had six children of his
own, the marriage took place privately at St. James’s,
Piccadilly; and the newly wedded pair, with the connivance
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>
of the friendly Crisp, spent their honeymoon
in a farm-house near Chessington. Even then, the
matter was kept quiet, being only revealed at last by
the misdelivery of a letter. After this, the second
Mrs. Burney took her place definitively as the mistress
of the Poland Street home, and the Lynn dower-house
became an additional holiday resort for the combined
family. The children on both sides seem to have been
delighted with an alliance which brought them more
intimately together; and the new mamma increased
rather than diminished the literary tone of the house.
“As Mrs. Stephen Allen,” says Mrs. Ellis, “she had
held a sort of <span class='it'>bas bleu</span> meeting once a week; as Mrs.
Burney, she received men of letters, or art, almost
daily, in an informal way.” One result of the marriage,
as already stated, was that Fanny and Charlotte did
not go to Paris. Charlotte was put to school in
Norfolk; and it was arranged that Susanna should
teach Fanny French.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the time of her father’s second marriage, Fanny
Burney was in her sixteenth year. Whether she had
written much previous to the return of her sisters from
Paris, cannot be affirmed; but it is evident that, with
the advent of the diary-keeping Susanna, her native
bias to scribbling rapidly increased. Every available
scrap of paper was covered with stories and humourous
sketches, confided only to the discreet ears of the
younger sister, who laughed and cried over these
masterpieces in secret. But it so chanced that Mrs.
Burney the second, with all her appreciation of the
<span class='it'>monde parleur</span>, was also keenly alive to the <span class='it'>misères
du monde scribe</span>. Something led her to suspect that
the girls were writing a good deal more than in her
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>
opinion was good for them, and the result was that
they were gently but firmly admonished not to spend
too much time in idle crude inventions. Thus,
one fine day, it came about that, in the paved play-court
at Poland Street, when her father was at Chessington
and her step-mother at Lynn, the docile Fanny
“made over to a bonfire” all her accumulated stock
of prose compositions. In the Preface to her last novel
of <span class='it'>The Wanderer</span>, where it is added that Susanna stood
weeping by, the date of this holocaust is given as her
fifteenth birthday (June 1767). But as it obviously
occurred some time after her father’s second marriage
in October of the same year, her memory must have
deceived her. Among the papers she burned was said
to be an entire work of fiction, to which we shall return.
Luckily,—although by this act she provisionally abjured
authorship, and the discredit supposed to attach in the
polite world to female writers and female writers of
novels and romances in particular,—she did not refrain
from journal-keeping. For the date of her first
entry in her <span class='it'>Early Diary</span> is May 30 [1768], at which
time Mr. Burney’s second marriage had been publicly
acknowledged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before dealing with those portions of this chronicle
which concern the present chapter, it is necessary
to say something of the proceedings of the father
of the family. In 1769 Mr. Burney, of whom we
shall hereafter speak as “Dr.” Burney, received his
Mus. D. degree at Oxford, his preliminary exercise
being an anthem which was performed in the Music
School, where it “was received with universal applause.”<a id='r9'/><a href='#f9' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[9]</span></sup></a>
The chief vocalist was one of the Doctor’s
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>
pupils, Miss Jenny Barsanti, often referred to in the
<span class='it'>Diary</span>; and Fanny wrote some congratulatory verses
to her father on his distinction, which, at all events,
exhibit a knack of rhyming. The receipt of his degree
appears to have revived all Dr. Burney’s dormant
literary ambitions. In matters connected with his
profession he had always been an industrious note-taker;
and he was also much interested in astronomy.
One of the results of this last taste was an anonymous
pamphlet prompted by the comet of 1769, at the close
of which year it was published. To this was appended
the translation from Maupertuis by the first Mrs.
Burney, of which mention has been made. The <span class='it'>Essay
on Comets</span> attracted no notice; but it served to
strengthen its author’s hand; and he began systematically
to look over the miscellaneous collections
he had accumulated towards that <span class='it'>History of Music</span> of
which he had dreamed at Lynn. In arranging and
transcribing the mass of material, Fanny fell naturally
into the office of amanuensis and keeper of the records.
But these had not long been manipulated before her
father discovered that it would be necessary for him
to make a personal tour in France and Italy,—first, to
procure information in regard to ancient music, and
secondly, to ascertain, by ear and eye, the actual condition
of the musical art on the Continent. At Paris
he visited Rousseau and Diderot, both of whom were
interested and helpful. At Ferney he had a chance
interview with Voltaire, then seventy-eight and wasted
to a skeleton, but still working ten hours a day, and
writing without spectacles. Discord, rather than
harmony, was the topic of this conversation. The
quarrels of authors—Voltaire held—were good for
<span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>
letters, just as, in a free government, the quarrels of
the great and the clamours of the small were necessary
to liberty. The silence of critics (he said) did not so
much prove the age to be correct, as dull. Dr. Burney
had started in June 1770; he did not return until
January 1771, when he almost immediately buried
himself at Chessington to prepare his notes and journal
for the press. In the following May his book was
printed under the title of <span class='it'>The Present State of Music in
France and Italy; or, the Journal of a Tour through those
Countries, undertaken to collect Materials for a General
History of Music</span>; and it obtained a considerable success.
Copies went to Mason, Hawkesworth, Garrick, and
Crisp, all of whom had aided in its progress. Among
its other readers must have been Johnson, who told
Mr. Seward that he had “that clever dog, Burney” in
his eye when, two years later, he wrote his own <span class='it'>Journey
to the Western Islands of Scotland</span>.<a id='r10'/><a href='#f10' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[10]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>During Dr. Burney’s absence abroad, his wife
had found the Poland Street house too small. She
accordingly fixed upon a fresh residence in Queen
<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>
Square, Bloomsbury, which was then much more in
the country than it is at present. The new home was
at the upper end of the square, which had been considerately
left open by the architect so as to afford a
delightful prospect, across Lamb’s Conduit Fields, of
Highgate and Hampstead, which Miss Burney—we
regret to say—spells “Hygate and Hamstead.” There
was also a special interest in the house itself, for it had
once been inhabited by Queen Anne’s printer, Alderman
Barber, the “<span class='it'>Johannes Tonsor</span>” and “very good and old
friend” of Swift; and it was a fond tradition of the
Burney household that the author of <span class='it'>Gulliver’s Travels</span>
had often dined with Barber at Queen Square. But
the <span class='it'>Journal to Stella</span>, when it mentions Barber, invariably
refers to him as in the City; and it is probable
that Swift visited him uniformly at his place of business.
In any case, the Queen Square house was “well fitted
up, convenient, and handsome.” Especially was there
a closet or playroom up two pair of stairs where Fanny
could retire to compose her Diary, for which task,
during her father’s absence abroad, she had unexpected
opportunities. But she had also another, and more picturesque
asylum in her step-mother’s dower-house at
Lynn. At the end of a long side garden was a “Look
Out” or Gazebo, called “The Cabin,” from which ships
could be seen on the Ouse. Here, except when she
was driven from it to the more secluded garden by the
profane language of the seafaring population, she was
accustomed to write and dream at her ease.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Burney’s activity did not permit him to pause
long after his first book. Very soon we hear that he
is learning German,—no doubt with a purpose. In
July, 1772, he set out upon a second tour, this time to
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>
collect materials for his history in Germany and the
Netherlands. During his absence, which lasted five
months, his family lived mainly at Lynn and Chessington.
In December he returned to England, terminating
his travels by an unique experience. Upon
his passage to Dover, in the very stormy winter of
1772, he was so exhausted by sea-sickness that he fell
asleep in his berth, and was carried back again to
Calais. On reaching Queen Square he had a severe
illness, requiring to be carefully nursed by his family;
but, with his customary energy, dictated to his
daughters, from his bed, portions of the new Tour
whenever the intervals of pain permitted him to do so.
As soon as he was convalescent, he hastened off to
Chessington, carrying his secretaries with him. The
result of his labours was at press in February, 1773,
and was published in May. It was received even more
kindly than its predecessor, and included detailed
<span class='it'>Proposals</span> for the forthcoming <span class='it'>General History of Music</span>.
Not many months after, in consequence of difficulties
as to title, the Queen Square house was given up, and
the Burneys moved to Leicester Fields.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With some account of the next new house, which
had, even then, its history, we may fitly open a fresh
chapter. In closing this one, however, something
must be said as to that <span class='it'>Early Diary</span> which Fanny Burney
began to keep in May 1768. When, in 1842-6, her
<span class='it'>Diary and Letters</span> were edited by her sister Charlotte’s
daughter, Mrs. Charlotte Francis Barrett, an amiable
and learned lady who happily combined a knowledge
of Hebrew with a genius for making jelly, it was
thought right to withhold the portions preceding the
publication of <span class='it'>Evelina</span>, as being “of a more private
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>
and personal nature than that which attaches to the
Journal after its writer became universally known.”
But in 1889, this earlier portion also was edited by the
late Mrs. Annie Raine Ellis from the original <span class='sc'>mss.</span>
which the first writer, in her own words, had freely
“curtailed and erased of what might be mischievous
from friendly or Family Considerations.” One of the
explanatory memoranda states, and another repeats,
that the record was begun at the age of fifteen. Prefixed
to the Diary, and “Addressed to a Certain Miss
Nobody,” is a whimsical Introduction, which Mrs.
Barrett reproduced in <span class='it'>facsimile</span> at the beginning of the
<span class='it'>Diary and Letters</span> of 1842-6. This, of course, may be
earlier than the rest, as it is said to be on older paper,
and in a slightly different hand. The Diary that
follows, as already stated, was considerably revised by
the writer in her old age; and, as reprinted in 1889,
shows numerous omissions. Of the record for 1769, for
example, Mrs. Ellis says, “Much has been cut from
the Diary of this year, and it has many erasures. It
appears to have been in two or three <span class='it'>cahiers</span>, which all
lie now within one quarto sheet of paper, so much are
they shrunk in size.” There are also large excisions
in the accounts for 1771 and 1772; and the manuscript
everywhere bears token of wholesale obliterations.
Where these are Miss Burney’s own, they are said to
be so effectual that scarcely a word can be read. In
future chapters, we shall take leave to make sundry
extracts from the Burney chronicle; but in this, where
only a brief period (1768-73) is in question, we may
fairly confine our citations to a few notes, relating
mainly to the diarist and her method.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the first lines of her address to Nobody, Miss
<span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>
Burney defines her purpose. The reason, she says,
which induces her to keep a Journal is that, “when
the hour arrives in which time is more nimble than
memory,” she may have some account of her “thoughts,
manners, acquaintance and actions.” Writing in the
Cabin at Lynn a little later, she reverts to this idea.
“I cannot express the pleasure I have in writing down
my thoughts, at the very moment—my opinion of
people when I first see them, and how I alter, or how
confirm myself in it—and I am much deceived in my
<span class='it'>fore sight</span>, if I shall not have very great delight in
reading this <span class='it'>living proof</span> of my manner of passing my
time, my sentiments, my thoughts of people I know,
and a thousand other things in future—there is something
to me very unsatisfactory in passing year after
year, without even a memorandum of what you did,
etc.” Presently, she has her difficulties. Dr. Burney
comes upon a fugitive page of this <span class='it'>chronique intime</span>, and
though he does not forbid the practice, protests that if
he finds it lying about he will post it up in the market
place. Then one of her mother’s friends, Miss Dorothy
Young (whom the first Mrs. Burney on her death-bed
had recommended her husband to marry) had her
doubts about this “most dangerous employment.”
“Suppose now,” says Miss Young, “your favourite
wish were granted, and you were <span class='it'>to fall in love</span> [it may
be noted that Fanny had already confided this tender
aspiration to her pages], and then the object of your
passion were to get sight of some part which related
to himself?” Here was an appalling suggestion, to
which Fanny could only reply that she should have
to take a precipitate trip to Rosamond’s Pond in St.
James’s Park, then the last resort of the despairing.
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>
It is characteristic of this very early entry in the
Diary, that the conversation is given exactly as if it
had been reported in shorthand. As the record
progresses, there are many similar instances of this
practice, which greatly irritated distrustful Mr. Croker.
“I shall recollect as much of the conversation as I can,
and make the parties speak for themselves,” Miss
Burney writes of a long interview with the currish
misogynist and Tory, Dr. John Shebbeare. And then
follows a dialogue to which the names of the speakers
are prefixed as they would be in a play.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some of the most interesting entries at this date
relate to her reading, and show that, instead of being,
as Lord Macaulay supposed,<a id='r11'/><a href='#f11' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[11]</span></sup></a> an infrequent student of
novels, her activity in this way was fully equal to her
opportunities. Richardson’s works she must have
known intimately, as she reminds her sister of their
early love for him; she reads and cries over and
criticises the <span class='it'>Vicar of Wakefield</span>; she reads <span class='it'>Rasselas</span>,
and thinks the style and sentiments inimitable. The
subject however is dreadful. “How terrible is it to
be told by a man of his [Johnson’s] genius and knowledge,
in so affectingly probable a manner, that true,
real, happiness is ever unattainable in this world!”
The <span class='it'>Sentimental Journey</span>,—which was a special favourite
with her step-mother,—she read three times; and,
from a reference to “Hobby Horses,” was probably
acquainted with <span class='it'>Tristram Shandy</span>, or at all events with
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>
its famous eighth chapter. Stranger still, she had
not only read Prévost’s <span class='it'>Doyen de Killérine</span> (with
which she is delighted), but that very stimulating
work, the <span class='it'>Vie de Marianne</span> of Marivaux. Further, she
occasionally quotes much inferior productions, <span class='it'>e.g.</span> the
<span class='it'>Henry and Frances</span> of Mrs. Griffiths, the <span class='it'>Lady Julia
Mandeville</span> of the once-popular Mrs. Brooke, and the
<span class='it'>Lydia</span> of Shebbeare. These are advanced mainly in
answer to Lord Macaulay. But the <span class='it'>Diary</span> contains
numerous references to studies of a sterner sort.
Among the books she speaks of reading, are Plutarch’s
<span class='it'>Lives</span>, Pope’s <span class='it'>Iliad</span> and <span class='it'>Odyssey</span>, Hawkesworth’s <span class='it'>Telemachus</span>,
Hume, Smollett, Smith’s <span class='it'>Thucydides</span>, Middleton’s
<span class='it'>Cicero</span>, Hooke’s <span class='it'>Roman</span>, and Stanyan’s <span class='it'>Grecian
History</span>,—all of which she professes to go through
systematically. Here is strong meat enough, one
would imagine, for a budding Mme. Roland;—certainly
it would be a trying course, in the days when skipping
was unknown, for even that model and methodical
student, Miss Clarissa Harlowe. Moreover it proves
plainly that Fanny’s close attention to braid-stitch,
cross-and-change, pinking, pointing, frilling, and all
the other niceties of that needlework which her step-mother
regarded as so important to young persons—did
not leave her without leisure for literature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To give any detailed summary of the material
contained in the first four years of Miss Burney’s
<span class='it'>Diary</span> would be impracticable here. There are several
portraits which (like that of Dr. Shebbeare) show that
the writer’s pen is already working willingly and
easily in what was to be her most congenial field.
There is a long description of the forgotten Spanish
traveller, Mr. Richard Twiss, a polyglot eccentric of
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>
the first water; there is another of a delightful fop
and cousin, Richard Burney, of Worcester, Junr.,
the son of Dr. Burney’s elder brother; there is a
picturesque <span class='it'>Journal</span>, addressed to Susan in 1773, of a
visit to Teignmouth,—or “Tingmouth,” as the writer
calls it,—which Mrs. Ellis fairly characterises as
“Fanny’s first book, privately circulated,” and which
contains some lively sketches of rural sports and
watering-place oddities. Some of these descriptions
and portraits go off in letters to “Daddy” Crisp at
Chessington, who is delighted, and gives his “dearest
Fannikin” some very seasonable advice, which, in after
years, she unhappily neglected. “If once you set
about framing studied letters, that are to be correct,
nicely grammatical, and run in smooth periods, I shall
mind them no otherwise than as newspapers of intelligence.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
There is no fault in an epistolary
correspondence like stiffness and study. Dash away
whatever comes uppermost; the sudden sallies of
imagination, clap’d down on paper, just as they arise,
are worth folios.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Never think of being correct
when you write to me.” Not the least notable of
Fanny’s records are the glimpses we get of some of
her father’s friends. One is poor mad Kit Smart,
always needy and out-at-elbows, with whom Burney
had grown acquainted at Arne’s, and who died in 1772
in the King’s Bench Prison. Another, who also died
in this period, is Hawkesworth, whose end, according
to Fanny, was certainly hastened by the attacks made
upon him in connection with his subsidised publication
of Cook’s <span class='it'>Voyages</span>. Garrick more or less pervades
the chronicle, dashing into the house in the most unexpected
manner; rushing away with little Charlotte
<span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>
whom he declares to be the image of <span class='it'>Comedy</span> in
Reynolds’s picture; acting, grimacing, mimicking,
posturing, and altogether comporting himself in every
respect like the excellent friend and histrion he was.
Fanny often sees him play—as Bayes in the <span class='it'>Rehearsal</span>;
as Richard the Third; as Lear, and as Abel Drugger
in the <span class='it'>Alchemist</span>. Of “crook’d back’d Richard” she
says,—“It is inconceivable how terribly great he is in
this character! I will never see him so disfigured
again; he seemed so truly the monster he performed,
that I felt myself glow with indignation every time
I saw him. The applause he met with, exceeds all
belief in the absent. I thought at the end they would
have torn the house down: our seats shook under us.”
Of Lear,—“He was exquisitely great; every idea I
had formed of his talents, although I have ever idolized
him, was exceeded.” But she very properly blames
Cibber’s feeble alterations of Shakespeare’s work. As
to Abel Drugger, perhaps Garrick’s greatest part, she
says:—“Never could I have imagined such a metamorphose
as I saw; the extreme meanness, the
vulgarity, the low wit, the vacancy of countenance, the
appearance of <span class='it'>unlicked nature</span> in all his motions.”
These are more than the opinions of an “unlessoned
girl,” for they are confirmed to the full by experienced
spectators such as Lichtenberg and Mme. Necker. To
Goldsmith, then not far from his end, there is passing
reference. “Dr. Goldsmith”—says the diary in May,
1773,—“has just brought on the stage a new comedy,
called, ‘She stoops to <span class='it'>Conquer</span>.’ We went to it with
Mr. and Mrs. Young; it is very laughable and comic;
but I know not how it is, almost all diversions are
insipid at present to me, except the opera.” There is
<span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span>
another mention of Goldsmith a few pages further on.
It relates to his projected <span class='it'>Dictionary of Arts and
Sciences</span>. Among other contributors, Dr. Burney was to
undertake the article “Musician.” But the plan never
got beyond the prospectus stage. Goldsmith died in
the following year, and Dr. Burney’s paper probably
found its ultimate place in his own <span class='it'>History of Music</span>.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER II<br/> <span class='sub-head'>NO. 1, ST. MARTIN’S STREET</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'>No. 1, St. Martin’s Street, now No. 35, to which the
Burneys moved early in 1774, may fairly be described
as a house with a history. We say “now,” since it
still exists,—standing to the right at the top of the
little street which opens into Leicester Square from the
south; and having on its left that Orange Street Congregational
Church where, in its Huguenot days, was
wont to preach Wesley’s opponent,—the Rev. Augustus
Montague Toplady. The house itself, once red brick,
but at present stuccoed over, is not impressive, save
for the distinction conferred by a Society of Arts tablet
which proclaims it to have been formerly the residence
of Newton. Miss Burney, indeed, as her father supposed,
declares that Sir Isaac built it; but this is an
error. He took it in 1710, when he was nearing
seventy, and he lived in it until 1725, two years before
he died at Kensington. Beyond occasional visits to
the Princess Caroline at Leicester House on the
opposite side of the Fields; and the fact that he
superintended the production of two editions of the
<span class='it'>Principia</span> during his period of residence, no very
definite traditions belong to his sojourn in St. Martin’s
Street. But Dr. Burney, who valued literary association,
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>
had a better reason for connecting his new
house with Swift, than he had for connecting him
with Queen Square. For in Newton’s house in
St. Martin’s Street had certainly dwelt one of Swift’s
intimates and Newton’s relatives, the beautiful and
witty Catherine Barton,—the “<span class='it'>jolie nièce</span>” of Voltaire,—and
the “Super-intendant of his domestick Affairs”
to Charles Montagu, Earl of Halifax, to whom, it is
conjectured, she was privately married. After the
death of Halifax in 1715, she became the wife of
John Conduitt, Newton’s successor as Master of
the Mint; and, when in town, was accustomed to
reside with her uncle in Leicester Fields. And it is
no great stretch of imagination to assume that, at such
times, though Swift himself was in exile, she was
visited by the other old friends who had clustered
around her when she was a Toast of the Kit Cats.
The chairs of Lady Worsley and Lady Betty
Germaine must often have waited at the narrow
approach by which the street was then entered from
the Fields, while their mistresses “disputed Whig and
Tory” with Mrs. Conduitt, or were interrupted in a
<span class='it'>tête-à-tête</span> by Gay and the Duchess of Queensberry.<a id='r12'/><a href='#f12' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[12]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>As regards situation, the change from Queen Square
to St. Martin’s Street was not entirely for the better.
It was no small loss to substitute an “unpleasant site,”
“confined air,” and a “shabby immediate neighbourhood”
for the unobstructed view of “Hampstead’s
<span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>
breezy Heath” which the Bloomsbury home afforded.<a id='r13'/><a href='#f13' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[13]</span></sup></a>
But in the way of convenience, and a central position,
the difference was great, in addition to which, compared
with its predecessor, the new residence was “large and
good.” It is true that the stairs were so steep and
narrow that one of Fulke Greville’s friends broke his
sword in climbing them; but, on the other hand, most
of the rooms were panelled, and one, at least, of the
ceilings “prodigiously painted and ornamented,” not,
as the Doctor was careful to explain, by him, but by
previous occupants. The chief glory of the house,
however, was the unpretentious structure at the top,
which passed for Sir Isaac’s observatory. It is perhaps
safest to say “passed,” because, between 1725 and 1774,
there must have been other dwellers in No. 1, St.
Martin’s Street, and many things may have happened.
But the Burneys seem to have devoutly believed in the
small-paned, wooden turret, with the leaden roof and
tiny fireplace, which embodied so respectable a tradition.
They exhibited it religiously to their visitors;
and one of its new owner’s first acts was to put it into
repair. When, four years later, it was all but whirled
away by the hurricane of 1778, he practically rebuilt
it. And it was unquestionably Fanny’s chosen retreat
and <span class='it'>scriptorium</span>. “His [Newton’s] observatory is my
favourite sitting place, where I can retire to read or
write any of my private fancies or vagaries.” And
then follows what—having regard to some of her previous
utterances—is more interesting than unexpected.<a id='r14'/><a href='#f14' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[14]</span></sup></a>
<span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>
“I burnt all up to my fifteenth year—thinking I grew
too old for scribbling nonsense, but as I am less young,
I grow, I fear, less wise, for I cannot any longer resist
what I find to be irresistible, the pleasure of popping
down my thoughts from time to time upon paper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whatever may have been her exact age at the date
of the famous <span class='it'>auto-da-fé</span> in the paved court at Poland
Street, she must have been nearing two and twenty
when she “popped down” the foregoing passage; and
the moment, taken in connection with the change of
scene from Bloomsbury to Leicester Fields is a favourable
one for reviewing the Burney family circle in
1774-5. Dr. Burney’s second or German Tour, as we
know, had been published in 1773; and in the same
year he had been made a Fellow of the Royal Society.
At present, in the intervals of rheumatism, he was
working, with Fanny’s aid, at his <span class='it'>History of Music</span>. By
his second wife he had two children,—Richard, and
Sarah Harriet, the latter of whom eventually, like her
gifted half-sister, became a novelist. But both Richard
and Harriet, at this date, were in the nursery. Esther,
or Hetty, the eldest daughter, had been married for
some time to her cousin, Charles Rousseau Burney,
afterwards of Bath, a musician and former pupil of
her father; while Maria Allen, the daughter of Dr.
Burney’s second wife, was married to a Mr. Rishton.
James Burney, the sailor, having sailed with Cook
in his second voyage, and been made a lieutenant,
had now returned home. In 1775 he was serving on
the North American Station, when he was recalled to
accompany Cook on his third and fatal expedition. Of
the rest, Susan and Charlotte were now grown up,
Charlotte being about fifteen, and Susan some years
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>
older. Charles, after having enjoyed the reputation
of being “the sweetest-tempered boy in the Charterhouse
School,” was now, in all probability, pursuing at
Cambridge those studies for which he was eventually
to be classed with Porson and Parr. The only one of
the Queen Square frequenters no longer to be encountered
at St. Martin’s Street was “Daddy” Crisp. By
this date he was sixty-eight, and his fits of gout had
become so severe, that he had ceased to make his annual
descents upon London from his Surrey hermitage.
But his interest in all that befell his friends at Leicester
Fields remained unabated; and in this he was kept
carefully posted up by his favourite “Fannikin,” who,
what with acting as librarian and amanuensis to her
indefatigable father, writing periodical news-letters of
“from six to twelve large quarto pages” to Chessington,
and keeping her own voluminous journal besides—must
have been very actively employed both in the
Observatory and out of it. Not without reason can it
have been that she acquired the “murtherous stooping”
which her Mentor deplored, nor was it entirely chargeable
to the shortness of sight which she shared with
Charlotte Brontë. It is from her bright and graphic
despatches to Mr. Crisp that we propose to draw most
of the material for this chapter. Often these are repeated
in her <span class='it'>Diary</span>, and they are also expanded in the
<span class='it'>Memoirs of Dr. Burney</span> which she wrote in later years;
but they are at their best and freshest in her letters,—letters
which, in many cases, must have been scribbled
off immediately after the occurrence of the events they
described. From one of them it is clear that their
writer thought nothing of setting to work at what
would now be considered a very lengthy epistle, when
<span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>
the entertainment of the evening had come to an
end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Queen Square circle had already been sufficiently
diversified; but it grew wider and even more varied
at Leicester Fields. Some of the Doctor’s friends were
now in his immediate vicinity. The family of Mr.
(afterwards Sir Robert) Strange, the engraver,—old
Paris acquaintances,—were, for the moment, lodging
close by. Reynolds, who had just painted the beautiful
Eliza Linley (Mrs. Sheridan) as “St. Cecilia,” lived
only just across the Fields at No. 47; and Garrick, in
the new house recently built for him by the brothers
Adam at the Adelphi, was not too far off to be a frequent
looker-in. Another artistic friend was the sculptor,
Joseph Nollekens, whom Burney had met in Italy.
James Barry, the eccentric and pugnacious Irish
painter from Castle Street, then engaged in decorating
the Meeting Room of the Society of Arts with vast
designs (in one of which Dr. Burney, in a queue and
tye-wig, figures incongruously among the nymphs of
the Thames),—was also among the familiar faces. But
the majority were naturally persons who were more or
less attracted to the Historian of Music. In this
category comes James Harris of Salisbury, “a most
charming old man,”—says Fanny, not only the author
of <span class='it'>Hermes</span>, but a writer upon Music, and a composer
whose pastoral of <span class='it'>Daphnis and Amaryllis</span> had actually
been produced at Drury Lane. With him was his wife,
the delightful Mrs. Harris whose gossiping letters to
her son, the first Earl of Malmesbury, are some of
the most charming in their kind. Then there was
another new friend, whom the Burney girls grew
to love almost as much as “Daddy” Crisp himself,
<span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>
the Rev. Thomas Twining of Fordham, near
Colchester, afterwards the translator of Aristotle’s
<span class='it'>Treatise on Poetry</span>. His acquaintance with Dr. Burney
had begun over the <span class='it'>German Tour</span>, for Twining, too, had
meditated a <span class='it'>History of Music</span>, which he abandoned in
favour of Burney’s. “They were far from young when
they met,”—says Twining’s brother and biographer referring
to the new friends,—“and they could ill afford
to lose time.”<a id='r15'/><a href='#f15' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[15]</span></sup></a> Besides these, there were the foreign
professionals who regarded the author of the <span class='it'>Tours</span> as
the supreme arbiter in matters musical:—the celebrated
<span class='it'>soprano</span>, Lucrezia Agujari, otherwise the <span class='it'>Bastardini</span>;
the almost equally celebrated Caterina Gabrielli,
and the <span class='it'>Inglesina</span>, Cecilia Davies; while the men were
represented by the singer and composer, Rauzzini,
who is so much commended in the <span class='it'>German Tour</span>, by
Gasparo Pacchieroti and others. Finally, there were
the “<span class='it'>Lyons</span>,”—as the diarist calls them,—the Otaheitan
Omai, who had come from the Society Islands with
Lieutenant Burney; and the Abyssinian traveller,
James Bruce of Kinnaird; and last, but by no means
largest, for Bruce was six feet four, the Russian
“man-mountain,” Alexis Orloff, who had certainly
helped to strangle his Imperial Master, Peter <span class='sc'>iii.</span>, and
was also—though not so surely—the reputed favourite
of that terrible Czarina who, according to Walpole,
had even more teeth than the famous Wild Beast of
the Gévaudan. The goings and comings of these, and
other notables and notorieties,—for those mentioned
<span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>
by no means exhaust the list,—must have been an
unexampled school of character to a budding novelist,
whose gift lay especially in seizing upon the peculiarities
of human nature, whose perceptions were at
their freshest and keenest, and whose singularly retentive
memory was not yet perplexed and bewildered
by too prolonged an experience of the very variegated
patchwork of Eighteenth Century society.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the first visits to St. Martin’s Street that
Fanny chronicles is one from that “most entertaining
of mortals, Mr. Garrick.” He arrived, as usual, very
early in the morning, marching straight into the study
where Dr. Burney, “surrounded by books and papers
innumerable,” was having his hair dressed. Fanny
was making breakfast; Charlotte reading the paper.
Nobody else was a-stir. “My father,”—says Miss
Burney,—“was beginning a laughing sort of apology
for his litters, and so forth, but Mr. Garrick interrupted
him with ‘Aye now; do be in a little confusion; it
will make things comfortable!’ ” He then began to
look gravely at the hairdresser. (Dr. Burney, it may
be stated in parenthesis wore his own hair,—a crop so
bushy and luxuriant that Frances Reynolds persisted
in regarding it as artificial.) “He (Garrick) was himself
in a most odious scratch-wig, which nobody but
himself could dare to be seen in. He put on a look in
the Abel Drugger style of <span class='it'>envy</span> and sadness, as he examined
the hairdresser’s progress; and, when he had
done, he turned to him with a dejected face, and said,
‘Pray Sir, could you touch up <span class='it'>this</span> a little?’ taking hold
of his own frightful scratch.” At which the hairdresser
only grinned, and left the room. But Garrick
continued his proceedings in the same mirthful spirit.
<span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>
He made enquiries as to the progress of the <span class='it'>History of
Music</span>, protesting that he was only waiting to blow the
trumpet of Fame, which he forthwith proceeded to do
with a stick, after the fashion of a Raree-Show-man.
“Here is the only true History, Gentlemen; please to
buy, please to buy. Sir, I shall blow it in the very
ear of yon scurvy magistrate”—by whom he meant
Sir John Hawkins of Twickenham, whom Horace
Walpole had incited to a rival performance. His final
exploit, after mimicking the Spanish traveller, Twiss,
and Dr. Arne, Burney’s old master, was to give a
dramatic rendering of an interview he had recently
had with Johnson,—not yet personally known to
the young ladies. Johnson had asked Garrick to
lend him a book, and Johnson’s carelessness about
books was notorious. “ ‘David, will you lend me
Petra[r]ca?’ ‘Yes, Sir.’ ‘David, you sigh.’ ‘Sir,
you shall have it.’ Accordingly, the book, finely bound,
was sent, but scarce had he received it, when uttering
a Latin ejaculation (which Mr. Garrick repeated) in a
fit of enthusiasm,—over his head goes poor Petra[r]ca,—Russia
leather and all!”<a id='r16'/><a href='#f16' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[16]</span></sup></a> After this the mercurial
actor bustled off to give breakfast to Boswell,
<span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>
promising to come soon, and plague them again. By
the Burney household Garrick was idolised; but Miss
Burney hints that where he was not on cordial terms,
he could contrive to make himself extremely disagreeable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Other early visitors were Bruce, the already mentioned
Abyssinian traveller, and the Otaheitan Omai.
We will take the traveller first. At this time he had
been twelve years abroad, four of which had been spent
in unexplored parts of Africa. “His figure is almost
gigantic! he is the tallest man I ever saw,” writes
Fanny,—who adds elsewhere that he almost frightened
Mr. Twining. “I cannot say I was charmed with him;
for he seems rather arrogant, and to have so large a
share of good opinion of himself, as to have nothing
left for the rest of the world but contempt. Yet his
self-approbation is not that of a <span class='it'>fop</span>; on the contrary,
he is a very manly character, and looks so dauntless
and intrepid, so that I believe he could never in his
life know what fear meant.” Despite his hauteur,
Bruce seems to have taken to the Burneys. He liked
music, and he lodged in Leicester Fields, so he came
often to their social evenings. He even favoured the
Doctor with two drawings, a Theban harp and an
Abyssinian lyre, which were copied for the <span class='it'>History of
Music</span>. The latter instrument prompted some rather
obvious gibes about Abyssinian <span class='it'>liars</span> from Walpole and
Selwyn. Bruce, as Johnson said, was “not a distinct
relater,” added to which his large, imperious and rather
swaggering manner prejudiced people against his stories,
and had the effect of delaying his account of his exploits
until a few years before his death in 1794. One of his
last appearances at St. Martin’s Street was in 1776,
<span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>
when he stayed to supper “which, you know, with
us, is nothing but a permission to sit over a table for
chat, and roast potatoes, or apples.” But “his Abyssinian
Majesty,” as Fanny calls him, neither discoursed
on this occasion upon the Abyssinian lyre, nor the merits
of raw beef-steaks as a diet. He only told a long and
rather stupid story of a practical joke at a masquerade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Omiah, Omai, Omy, or familiarly, Jack,—the other
“<span class='it'>lyon</span> of <span class='it'>lyons</span>”—came to St. Martin’s Street upon the
invitation of James Burney, whose sister gives detailed
accounts of his visits. At the time of the first, the
Society Islander, of whom, in his native state, there
is a portrait in Cook’s <span class='it'>Voyages</span>, can only have been a few
months in England. But although he had not learned
English, he had already acquired all the externals of
a fine gentleman. He arrived betimes, after a preliminary
note in due form, arrayed splendidly in a Court
suit of Manchester velvet lined with white satin, a bag,
laced ruffles (on his tattooed hands), and a very handsome
sword which had been given him by King George
the Third. Though not handsome, he was tall and
well proportioned. “He makes <span class='it'>remarkable</span> good bows—not
for <span class='it'>him</span> but for <span class='it'>anybody</span>, however long under
a Dancing Master’s care,” writes Miss Burney. “Indeed
he seems to shame Education, for his manners
are so extremely graceful, and he is so polite, attentive,
and easy, that you would have thought he came from
some Foreign Court,”—a sentiment which seems later
to have prompted a comparison between the lamentable
failure of Lord Chesterfield’s precepts to make of Philip
Stanhope anything but a “pedantic booby,” and the
exemplary rapidity with which Otaheitan Omiah had
contrived to “cultivate the Graces.” Miss Burney saw
<span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>
Omiah again before he returned to Ulietea. Upon
this occasion, he obliged the company with “a song
of his own country,” which, from his subsequent
analysis, must have comprised the entire <span class='it'>scenario</span> of a
comic opera. But his audience were too musical, and
it was not a success. “So queer, wild, strange a
<span class='it'>rumbling of sounds</span> never did I before hear, and very
contentedly can I go to the grave, if I never do again.
His [Omiah’s] <span class='it'>song</span> is the only thing that is <span class='it'>savage</span>
about him.”<a id='r17'/><a href='#f17' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[17]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>But it is time—looking to the limitations of our
space—to turn from the specific to the general, and
give some account of the St. Martin’s Street musical
evenings. Already at Poland Street and Queen Square
these entertainments had been the rule; and at
Newton’s house, with the Doctor’s increasing popularity,
they attained their greatest importance. Moreover,
they found, as they had not before found, their
faithful chronicler in Daddy Crisp’s correspondent.
The chief performers on ordinary occasions seem to
have been Esther Burney and her husband, their <span class='it'>pièce
de résistance</span> being Müthel’s Duet for two harpsichords.
Another famous harpsichord player was the Baroness
Deiden, the wife of the Danish Ambassador, whose
reputation is said to have been European. But the
“peacock’s brains” of the record was certainly the
Agujari, and Miss Burney’s enthusiasm overflows.
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>
Carestini, Farinelli, Senesino, all Mr. Crisp’s old idols,—’twas
to these only that the <span class='it'>Bastardini</span> could be compared.
And she seems certainly to have done her best.
She arrived for tea before seven, stayed till twelve,
sang almost all the time, permitted her hearers to
encore nearly every song, and sang moreover in twenty
different styles, minuets, cantabiles, church-music,
bravuras and even that popular Vauxhall <span class='it'>misère</span>, the
rondeau, growing at last so excited over an <span class='it'>aria parlante</span>
from the <span class='it'>Didone Abbandonata</span> (“<span class='it'>Son Regina, e sono
Amante</span>”) that “she acted it throughout with great
spirit and feeling.” This was pretty well for the lady
whom Macaulay qualifies as the “rapacious” Agujari,
apparently because, at this date, she was earning fifty
pounds a song—which she thoroughly deserved, since
people went to hear her and no one else—at the
Oxford Street Pantheon.<a id='r18'/><a href='#f18' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[18]</span></sup></a> But she had an exceedingly
appreciative audience, limited by her own request to
the Burney family; she was tired of singing at concerts,
book in hand, “<span class='it'>comme une petite écolière</span>,” and
most of all, she was anxious to give the Historian of
Music, who was also all-powerful in matters operatic,
a taste of her real quality. It does not appear that
she ever repeated her performances at St. Martin’s
Street, so that it would be inaccurate to represent her
as figuring habitually and gratuitously at the Burney
“conversations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the next things which Fanny recounts to
Mr. Crisp is the production, at the Opera House in
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>
the Haymarket, of that very <span class='it'>Didone</span> of Metastasio from
which Agujari had borrowed her <span class='it'>aria parlante</span>. But
the <span class='it'>diva</span> upon this occasion (Saturday, Nov. 11, 1775)
was Caterina Gabrielli, who seems to have behaved
with all her traditional caprice. The Burney family,
who occupied the front row of the first gallery, are
terribly divided as to her merits. “She was most
<span class='it'>impertinently</span> easy,” says Fanny, “visibly took no pains,
and never in the least exerted herself.” Elsewhere she
writes, “Her voice is feeble, but sweetly toned. She
has great powers of execution; but—she is no Agujari!”
And thereupon, in the contest and confusion of opinion,
the writer turns to a little concert that has just taken
place in St. Martin’s Street, “at which <span class='it'>assisted</span> a most
superb party of company.” It originated in the desire
of Dr. King, sometime chaplain to the British factory
at St. Petersburg, that the famous Prince Orloff,<a id='r19'/><a href='#f19' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[19]</span></sup></a>
before he left England, should hear Hetty and her
husband in Müthel’s duet. Both in her <span class='it'>Diary</span> and
Letters, Fanny has treated this exceptional entertainment
at considerable length; and she subsequently
“embroidered” the record in the Memoirs of her
father. We shall depend, by preference, upon her
account to Mr. Crisp. After introducing the guests
as they arrive:—Dr. Ogle, the musical Dean of Winchester;
Dr. King, who announces consequentially
that the Prince, having dined at Lord Buckingham’s,
is coming as soon as he has been to Lady Harrington’s
rout; the <span class='it'>virtuosa</span>, Lady Edgecumbe (“all condescension,
<span class='it'>repartee</span> (<span class='it'>and yet</span>) good humour”); Mr. Charles
Boone, the fine gentleman who broke his sword in the
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>
staircase; Mrs. Brudenel; Mr. Anthony Chamier—all
of whose conversation turns upon the Gabrielli and
her performance of the evening before,—one of the
<span class='it'>rat, tat, tats</span> with which the diarist diversifies her narrative,
announces M. le Baron de Demidoff, thin, long-nosed,
with a most <span class='it'>triste</span> and foreign countenance.
M. de Demidoff travels with the Prince, whose <span class='it'>avant-coureur</span>
he is. He brings the gratifying intelligence that
His Highness is detained at Lady Harrington’s, but
may be expected with the least possible delay. Then
follow Mr. Harris of Salisbury, Lord Bruce, a younger
brother of the Duke of Montague (who has been
to St. Martin’s <span class='it'>Lane</span> by mistake)—and so forth. At
last—like Charlemagne after his Paladins—appears
Prince Orloff, accompanied by General Bawr, a
Hessian, stern, martial, who has seen service in the
Turkish war. And here we most willingly surrender
the pen to Miss Burney. “The Prince is another
Mr. Bruce, being immensely tall and stout in proportion.
He is a handsome and magnificent figure.
His dress was very superb. Besides a blue Garter
he had a star of diamonds of prodigious brilliancy;
he had likewise a <span class='it'>shoulder knot</span> of the same <span class='it'>precious
jewels</span>, and a picture of the Empress hung from his
neck, which was set round with diamonds of such
magnitude and lustre that, when near the candle, they
were too dazzling for the eye. His jewels, Dr. King
says, are valued at above £100,000. He was extremely
gracious and polite, and appears to be <span class='it'>addicted to
pleasantry</span>. He speaks very little English but knows
French perfectly. He was received by my father in the
drawing-room. The library, where the music was, was
so crowded, he only shewed himself at the door, where
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>
he bowed to Mr. Chamier, who had met with him
elsewhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Müthel duet, which had been postponed for
the Prince’s arrival, was then played with prodigious
applause, relaxing even the “sorrowful countenance”
of the Baron de Demidoff, who clapped his snuff box
rapturously, calling out in broken English, “<span class='it'>Dis is so
pretty as ever I heard in my life!</span>” Lord Bruce, turning
to Prince Orloff, told him the performers were man
and wife. His Highness seemed surprised, and walking
up to Mrs. Burney, made her many compliments;
and, expressing his wonder that two such executants
should chance to be united, added “<span class='it'>Mais, qu’a produit
tant d’Harmonie?</span>” To this Hetty, in a flutter, could
find no fitter reply than “<span class='it'>Rien, Monseigneur, que trois
enfants</span>,”—that being the extent of her family,—an
artless and unexpected answer at which Monseigneur
laughs immoderately, and, being “addicted
to pleasantry,” retails freely to those about him, with
many “droll comments and observations” on Mrs.
Burney’s words. “When the room was a good deal
<span class='it'>thinned</span>”—Fanny goes on—“Mr. Harris told me he
wished some of <span class='it'>the ladies</span> would express a desire of
seeing the <span class='it'>Empress’s picture</span> nearer. ‘I, you know,’
said he, ‘as a <span class='it'>man</span>, cannot, but my old eyes can’t see
it at a distance.’ ” [The truth was, Mr. Harris wished
to be able to compare Orloff’s picture of Catherine II.
with his son James’s (Lord Malmesbury’s) portrait of
the King of Spain.] “I went up to Dr. King, and
made the request to him. He hesitated some time,
but afterwards <span class='it'>hinted</span> the demand to General Bawr,
who boldly made it to the Prince. His Highness
laughed, and with great good humour, desired the
<span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>
General to untie the picture from his neck, and present
it to us; and he was very facetious upon the occasion,
desiring to know if we wanted anything else? and
saying that if they pleased, <span class='it'>the ladies</span> might <span class='it'>strip him
entirely</span>! Not very elegant, methinks, his pleasantry!
When we got it there was hardly any looking at the
Empress for the glare of the diamonds. Their size is
almost incredible. One of them, I am sure, was as
big as a <span class='it'>nut-meg</span> at <span class='it'>least</span>. When we were all satisfied
it was returned, and the Prince most graciously made
a bow to, and received a curtsie from, everyone who
looked at it.”<a id='r20'/><a href='#f20' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[20]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>In the remainder of Fanny’s letters to Mr. Crisp, she
gives an account of a further concert arising out of
the famous duet. This time the principal guest was
the Count (afterwards the Duke) de Guines, the French
Ambassador, who was not only a <span class='it'>virtuoso</span> of the first
order, but an accomplished flute-player, who had the
reputation of having dared to beard that other distinguished
performer on the same instrument, Frederick
the Great. His Majesty had said to him impatiently
and impertinently—“<span class='it'>Je vous prie, qu’est-ce que fait votre
maître quand il ne peut pas chasser De Guisnes?</span>” The
Count—a typical aristocrat of the pre-Revolution days—shrugged
his shoulders, and made answer, “<span class='it'>Il est
vrai, Sire, que mon maître n’a pas le bonheur de savoir jouer
de la flûte</span>,”<a id='r21'/><a href='#f21' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[21]</span></sup></a> a retort more dexterous than deserved,
since Frederick, whom Dr. Burney had listened to at
Potsdam, was not by any means a mere amateur.
Lady Edgecumbe had talked so much to M. de Guines
about the duet, that he expressed a great desire to
<span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>
hear it, and a second concert had to be arranged.
The company convened on this occasion included Lord
Ashburnham, “Groom of the Stole, and First Lord
of the Bedchamber,” the Baron and Baroness Deiden,
Lord Barrington, Lord Sandwich (“Jemmy Twitcher,”
to wit), and Signor Venanzio Rauzzini, the “pius
Æneas” to the Dido of Gabrielli. Rauzzini was
vainly implored to indulge the company with a
<span class='it'>Rondeau de sa façon</span>—<span class='it'>i.e.</span> from his own <span class='it'>Piramo e Tisbe</span>;
but he pleaded the professional cold. Fanny is
enchanted with the young Roman’s appearance. “He
looked like an angel,” she writes. “Nothing can be
more beautiful than this youth. He has the complection
of our Dick,—the very finest white and red
I ever saw: his eyes are the sweetest in the world,
at once soft and spirited: all his features are animated
and <span class='it'>charming</span>.” “ ‘<span class='it'>Avez vous une Assemblée chez vous
tous les Dimanches</span>,’<a id='r22'/><a href='#f22' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[22]</span></sup></a> cried he, to my father. ‘<span class='it'>Je
viendrai une autre fois quand je pourrai chanter!</span>’ Only
think how we were <span class='it'>let down</span>! ‘<span class='it'>Une autre fois!</span>’ cried
Hetty; ‘<span class='it'>Une autre fois!</span>’ echoed Susette; ‘<span class='it'>Une autre
fois!</span>’ still more pathetically echoed your humble
servant.” But he contributed his quota to the gossip
about the Gabrielli; and when the oft-told story was
repeated as to the extraordinary ceremonial parade
she observed in quitting the Opera House on Saturdays,
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>
with first a running footman to clear the way,
then her sister, then herself, then a page for her
train, then another footman, and then a man out of
livery to carry her lap-dog in her muff,—Rauzzini
interjected, “<span class='it'>Et puis, une autre pour un singe, et un autre
pour un perroquet!</span>” As to “Mrs. Gabrielle” (for so
she styled herself on her Golden Square doorplate), it
is manifest that her reputation for whim had created
considerable prejudice against her. But in the <span class='it'>History
of Music</span> Dr. Burney, who knew her intimately, is
much milder in his expressions than the more excitable
members of his family. He says that despite her low
origin (she was the daughter of a Cardinal’s cook at
Rome), she had extraordinary grace and dignity of
gesture. She was, moreover he declared, the most
intelligent and best bred <span class='it'>virtuosa</span> with whom he ever
conversed, speaking like a well-educated woman, who
had seen the world, not only on music, but on other
subjects. “In youth,” he writes, “her beauty and
caprice had occasioned an universal delirium among
her young countrymen, and there were still remains
of both sufficiently powerful, while she was in England,
to render credible their former influence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That Fanny’s detailed despatches delighted her correspondent
at Chessington, is only to be expected.
“You have produc’d such an illustrious assembly of
Princes, and generals, and lords, and ladies, and wits,
and pictures, and diamonds, and shoulder-knots, that
I feel myself shrink into nothing at the idea of them,—nay,
you yourself that made one among them, seem to
be a little dazzled at their glare.” And then Mr.
Crisp rallies her upon her evident admiration of the
“beautiful Rauzzini.” In another letter there is a
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>
significant sentence. “You have learned from that
R[<span class='it'>ogue</span>] your father (by so long serving as amanuensis,
I suppose) to make your descriptions alive”—an utterance
which, while it throws some light on the vexed
question of Miss Burney’s style, also recalls us to the
progress of that <span class='it'>History of Music</span>, in which she bore so
laborious a part. In March 1775 it had come to a
“dead stop” owing to Dr. Burney’s rheumatism, which
prevented him from writing; and in April it was
scarcely moving. “My father’s History goes on very
slowly indeed at present.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He teaches from nine
to nine almost every day, and has scarce time to write
a page a week.” Still, it gradually progresses, and in
October, Fanny is able to report that the first volume
is ready. “The History has been this very day, for the
first time since its long cessation, put into the press[?].
It is now <span class='it'>rough</span> written to the end of the first volume,
Preface and Dedication inclusive. When it is actually
<span class='it'>published</span>, we intend to keep the Carnival.” A few days
before, the Dedication to the Queen had been read by
Dr. Burney to an admiring friend; and in 1776 the
first volume was issued, when, we may conclude, the
Carnival was duly kept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But of this, unhappily, no record has been preserved;
and it was some years before a second volume gave
the busy Doctor opportunity for a further jubilation.<a id='r23'/><a href='#f23' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[23]</span></sup></a>
Beyond the fact that the Burneys, and Fanny in particular,
made friends (through the Stranges) with the
Miss Paynes, daughters of the famous old bookseller in
Castle Street, “next the Upper Mews-Gate,” whose
L-shaped shop was so well known to Eighteenth Century
<span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span>
bibliomaniacs,<a id='r24'/><a href='#f24' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[24]</span></sup></a>—little remains of interest from the
records of 1775. For 1776 there is no journal at all,
what had been written having been “destroyed in
totality,” as consisting wholly of family matters or
anecdotes; and save for a very graphic picture of the
slatternly Duchess of Devonshire in St. James’s Park,
no very attractive correspondence, although Mr. Crisp
refers to a “conversation piece” which Fanny drew of
the fine company at the house of Sir James Lake, the
great portrait collector, which should have been good
to read. “If specimens of this kind had been preserved
of the different <span class='it'>Tons</span> that have succeeded one
another for twenty centuries last past,” he writes, “how
interesting would they have been! infinitely more so,
than antique statues, bas-reliefs, and intaglios.” In
a fragment dated 2 December there is a vignette of
Nollekens the sculptor, “a jolly, fat, lisping, laughing,
underbred, good-humoured man as lives: his merit
seems pretty much confined to his profession, and his
language is as vulgar as his works are elegant.” Mrs.
Nollekens (the very handsome daughter of Fielding’s
friend Justice Welch), his wife, is also mentioned: “a
civil, obliging, gentle sort of woman; rather too complaisant.”
Then there is a costume-piece of “Miss
B—— <span class='it'>something</span>, a sister-in-law of Mr. Hayes of the
Pantheon,” and not entirely unsuggestive of Lady
Louisa Larpent in <span class='it'>Evelina</span>; “a young lady quite <span class='it'>à-la-mode</span>,—every
part of her dress, the very pink and
extreme of the fashion;—her [head] erect and stiff as
any statue;—her voice low, and delicate, and mincing;—her
hair higher than twelve wigs stuck one on the
<span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span>
other;—her waist taper, and pinched evidently;—her
eyes cast languishingly from one object to another, and
her conversation very much <span class='it'>the thing</span>.” Decidedly
“Daddy” Crisp was right in saying: “To do you
justice, Fanny, you paint well!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the next year, 1777, there is only one letter to
Mr. Crisp; but it is an important one, since it gives
Miss Burney’s account of her first meeting with Dr.
Johnson, to which accident, indeed, it owes its preservation.
Dr. Burney had for some time known
Johnson slightly,—he had written to him from Lynn
with regard to the Dictionary; he had also met him
at intervals; and, as we have seen, Johnson, notwithstanding
his insensibility to music, had read and
appreciated the Musical Tours. Writing Dr. Burney’s
<span class='it'>Memoirs</span> in extreme old age, his daughter seems to
have thought that Johnson had already accompanied
her father to Winchester to put his youngest son,
Richard, under the care of the then Head Master of
that day, Joseph Warton; and that he had also, before
this date, interested himself to procure Dr. Burney
access to the libraries at Oxford. But her memory
must have led her astray, for both these things, as is
plain from Boswell, belong to 1778, while Miss Burney’s
“first sight” of the great man demonstrably took place
on the 20th March, 1777,<a id='r25'/><a href='#f25' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[25]</span></sup></a> and came about in this wise.
Dr. Burney had been invited by Mr. and Mrs. Thrale
to give lessons in music to their eldest daughter,
Queenie, afterwards Viscountess Keith. Report says
that the lessons were not a great success, since Mrs.
Thrale was in the habit of interrupting them sadly in
<span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span>
order to talk politics and literature with the clever
Historian of Music. But, as usual, Dr. Burney
speedily became a favourite with all the household;
and, as Johnson was then staying at Streatham, one
of the results was a joint visit by the Doctor and Mrs.
Thrale to St. Martin’s Street, which visit was promptly
reported by Fanny for consumption at Chessington.
It took place fourteen years before Boswell’s book, and
as printed in the <span class='it'>Early Diary</span> of 1889, exhibits a fresher
version than that put forward later by the writer herself
in the <span class='it'>Memoirs</span> of her father. No excuse therefore
is needed for giving it the preference here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. and Miss Thrale, Miss Owen, and Mr. Seward
came long before <span class='it'>Lexiphanes</span>. [This was a name given
to Johnson in 1767, in a little book written to burlesque
his style by a Scotch purser named Campbell.]
Mrs. Thrale is a very pretty woman still; she is
extremely lively and chatty; has no supercilious or
pedantic airs, and is really gay and agreeable. Her
daughter [Queenie] is about twelve years old, stiff and
proud, I believe, or else shy and reserved: I don’t yet
know which.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. “My sister Burney [Esther] was
invited to meet and play to them. The conversation
was supported with a good deal of vivacity (N.B. my
father being at home) for about half an hour, and then
Hetty and <span class='it'>Susette</span>, for the first time <span class='it'>in public</span>, played a
duet; and in the midst of this performance Dr. Johnson
was announced. He is, indeed, very ill-favoured; is
tall and stout; but stoops terribly; he is almost bent
double. His mouth is almost constantly opening and
shutting, as if he was chewing. He has a strange
method of frequently twirling his fingers, and twisting
his hands. His body is in continual agitation, <span class='it'>see-sawing</span>
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>
up and down; his feet are never a moment
quiet; and, in short, his whole person is in <span class='it'>perpetual
motion</span>. His dress, too, considering the times, and that
he had meant to put on his <span class='it'>best becomes</span>, being engaged
to dine in a large company [at Mrs. Montagu’s], was
as much out of the common road as his figure; he had
a large wig, snuff-colour coat, and gold buttons, but no
ruffles to his shirt, doughty fists,<a id='r26'/><a href='#f26' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[26]</span></sup></a> and black worsted
stockings. He is shockingly near-sighted, and did not,
till she held out her hand to him, even know Mrs.
Thrale. He <span class='it'>poked his nose</span> over the keys of the harpsichord,
till the duet was finished, and then my father
introduced Hetty to him as an old acquaintance, and
he cordially kissed her! When she was a little girl,
he had made her a present of <span class='it'>The Idler</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His attention, however, was not to be diverted five
minutes from the books, as we were in the library; he
pored over them, shelf by shelf, almost touching the
backs of them with his eye-lashes, as he read their
titles. At last, having fixed upon one, he began, without
further ceremony, to read to himself, all the time
standing at a distance from the company. We were
all very much provoked, as we perfectly languished to
hear him talk; but it seems he is the most silent
creature, when not particularly drawn out, in the
world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My sister then played another duet with my father;
but Dr. Johnson was so deep in the <span class='it'>Encyclopédie</span> that,
as he is very deaf, I question if he even knew what
<span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>
was going forward. When this was over, Mrs. Thrale,
in a laughing manner, said, ‘Pray, Dr. Burney, can
you tell me what that song was and whose, which
Savoi sung last night at Bach’s concert, and which you
did not hear?’ My father confessed himself by no
means so good a diviner, not having had time to consult
the stars, though in the house of Sir Isaac Newton.
However, wishing to draw Dr. Johnson into some
conversation, he told him the question. The Doctor,
seeing his drift, good-naturedly put away his book,
and said very drolly, ‘And pray, Sir, <span class='it'>who is Bach</span>? is
he a piper?’ Many exclamations of surprise you will
believe followed this question. ‘Why, you have read
his name often in the papers,’ said Mrs. Thrale; and
then she gave him some account of his Concert,
and the number of fine performances she had heard
at it.<a id='r27'/><a href='#f27' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[27]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Pray,’ said he, gravely, ‘Madam, what is the
expense?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Oh,’ answered she, ‘much trouble and solicitation
to get a Subscriber’s Ticket;—or else half a Guinea.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Trouble and solicitation,’ said he, ‘I will have
nothing to do with; but I would be willing to give
eighteen pence.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! ha!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chocolate being then brought, we adjourned to
the drawing-room. And here, Dr. Johnson being
taken from the books, entered freely and most cleverly
into conversation; though it is remarkable he never
<span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span>
speaks at all, but when spoken to; nor does he ever
<span class='it'>start</span>, though he so admirably <span class='it'>supports</span>, any subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The whole party were engaged to dine at Mrs.
Montague’s. Dr. Johnson said he had received the
most flattering note he had ever read, or that anybody
had ever read, by way of invitation. ‘Well! so
have I too,’ cried Mrs. Thrale; ‘so if a note from Mrs.
Montague is to be boasted of, I beg mine may not be
forgot.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘<span class='it'>Your</span> note,’ cried Dr. Johnson, ‘can bear no comparison
with <span class='it'>mine</span>; I am <span class='it'>at the head of the Philosophers</span>,
she says.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘And I,’ cried Mrs. Thrale, ‘<span class='it'>have all the Muses in
my train</span>!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘A fair battle,’ said my father. ‘Come, compliment
for compliment, and see who will hold out
longest!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Oh, I am afraid for Mrs. Thrale,’ cried Mr. Seward,
‘for I know Mrs. Montague exerts all her forces, when
she attacks Dr. Johnson.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Oh yes,’ said Mrs. Thrale, ‘she has often, I know,
flattered <span class='it'>him</span>, till he has been ready to faint.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well, ladies,’ said my father, ‘you must get him
between you to-day, and see which can lay on the paint
thickest, Mrs. Thrale or Mrs. Montague.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I had rather,’ cried the Doctor, drily, ‘go to
Bach’s Concert.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The talk then shifted to Garrick, who, having retired
from the stage in the previous year, had been recently
reading his farce of <span class='it'>Lethe</span> to the King and Queen. Dr.
Johnson spoke of his old friend and pupil with his
wonted candour, and not without touches of critical
humour which must have been highly relished by that
<span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span>
still-sore author of <span class='it'>Virginia</span> to whom Miss Burney’s
budget was addressed. Of Garrick’s popular faults
Johnson said—“Garrick is accused of vanity; but
few men would have borne such unremitting prosperity
with greater, if with equal moderation. He is accused,
too, of avarice; but, were he not, he would be accused
of just the contrary; for he now lives rather as <span class='it'>a prince</span>
than an actor; but the frugality he practised, when he
first appeared in the world, and which, even then, was
perhaps beyond his necessity, has marked his character
ever since; and now, though his table, his equipage
and manner of living, are all the most expensive, and
equal to those of a nobleman, yet the original stain
still blots his name! Though, had he not fixed upon
himself the charge of avarice, he would long since have
been reproached with luxury and with living beyond
his station in magnificence and splendour.” Another
of the Doctor’s animadversions serves to explain an
aspect of the actor’s character which has already been
illustrated in this chapter.<a id='r28'/><a href='#f28' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[28]</span></sup></a> “Garrick never enters a
room,” he said, “but he regards himself as the object
of general attention, from whom the entertainment
of the company is expected; and true it is, that he
seldom disappoints them; for he has infinite humour,
a very just proportion of wit, and more convivial
pleasantry, than almost any other man. But then <span class='it'>off</span>
as well as <span class='it'>on</span> the Stage, he is always an Actor; for he
thinks it so incumbent on him to be sportive, that his
gaiety becomes mechanical from being habitual, and
he can exert his spirits at all times alike, without consulting
his real disposition to hilarity.”<a id='r29'/><a href='#f29' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[29]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>Previous to Dr. Johnson’s visit to St. Martin’s
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>
Street, Miss Burney had been staying at Chessington,
whence, to the disgust of Mr. Crisp, she had been
hastily recalled to meet her uncle, Mr. Richard Burney
of Worcester, whose son Charles her sister Hetty had
married. She then went on a visit to her uncle at
Barborne (familiarly “Barebones”) Lodge, a little out
of Worcester; and here she took part in some private
theatricals, playing Mrs. Lovemore in what was
apparently the first three-act form of Murphy’s <span class='it'>Way
to Keep Him</span>, a comedy in which there are manifest
traces of that pioneer sentimental drama, La Chaussée’s
<span class='it'>Préjugé à-la-mode</span>—the prejudice in question being, that
it is a mistake to love one’s wife. She seems, by her
own account, to have been terribly nervous (in green
and gray); but to have acquitted herself creditably
in the crucial third Act. She afterwards appeared as
<span class='it'>Huncamunca</span> in Fielding’s burlesque of <span class='it'>Tom Thumb</span>, the
rival character of Glumdalca being taken by her cousin
James, and that of Lord Grizzle by Edward Burney
the artist. The Tom Thumb of the piece was the
youngest of the family, Ann or Nancy, a child of seven,
the daughter of Charles Burney and Hetty. By this
time Miss Burney had entirely got over her stage
fright, and entered thoroughly into her part of Tom
Thumb’s <span class='it'>fiancée</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the things Huncamunca has to do in <span class='it'>Tom
Thumb</span> is to express her anxiety to be married. It is
not, however, this unbecoming aspiration (upon which
Miss Burney was of course afterwards sufficiently
rallied) that prompts the “Oh! Huncamunca, Huncamunca,
oh!” of Fielding’s parody of Thomson. But
the point serves to remind us that, in this chapter,
nothing has been said of Miss Burney’s admirers.
<span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>
Scattered through her Journal are various fugitive
references to different gentlemen, old and young, who
were evidently attracted by her vivacity and charm,
shy and demure as she professed to be. But she had
not yet realised her own ambition, and fallen seriously
in love. “I am too much spoilt,” she says, “by such
men as my father and Mr. Crisp to content myself with
a character merely inoffensive.” These words were
written of an importunate suitor, with the unpromising
name of Thomas Barlow, who made his appearance
early in May, 1775. He seems to have been very much
in earnest, indeed,—to use the expression of Mr. Toots,
of whom he somehow contrives to remind us,—to have
been “perfectly sore” with devotion. His ardent, or
(as he terms it) “ardurous” Pen addresses to Miss
Burney several long-winded and very alembicate
epistles, but she will have none of him, although,
strange to say, nearly all her family, including the
paternal Crisp,—who was particularly urgent that she
should not lose a chance of establishing herself,—favour
Mr. Barlow’s pretensions. But, as she very
sensibly tells Mr. Crisp, she is “determined never to
marry without having the very highest value and
esteem for the man who should be her lord.” And
Mr. Barlow, besides that he is “extremely precipitate,”
does not “hit her fancy.” So there is no more to
say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon the whole, when it is remembered that this
retiring but observant young lady of five-and-twenty
had a travelled sailor brother, and two sisters who had
been educated at Paris;—that she had seen the town
and country both in London and King’s Lynn;—that
she had read Richardson and Marivaux and Sterne,
<span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>
if not Fielding;—that she knew Sir Joshua and
Nollekens, and was familiar with the acting of Garrick,
both on and off the stage;—that she had heard Agujari
at her best, and the Gabrielli at her worst;—that she
had been introduced to Dr. Johnson and Mrs. Thrale;—that
she had conversed with Otaheitan Omai, eaten
roast apples with Abyssinian Bruce, and been allowed
to inspect what Horace Walpole calls the “infamous
diamonds” of the veneered barbarian, Alexis Orloff,—it
will, we think, be admitted that her experience of
things in general had been of a very varied kind.
If to this be added that she was a copious and diligent
diarist;—the sworn “anecdote-monger” of a distant
correspondent;—and the faithful secretary of a scribbling
father—it must also be granted that she was by
no means ill-equipped for the production of that work
of fiction to the story of which the ensuing chapter is
devoted.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER III<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE STORY OF <span class='it'>EVELINA</span></span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'>At the beginning of 1778, English Literature, and
especially that branch of it which consists of fiction,
seems to have been suffering from a kind of sleeping
sickness. The great masters who had followed upon
Richardson’s success with <span class='it'>Pamela</span>, were gone,—as was
Richardson himself. Fielding, whose last novel of
<span class='it'>Amelia</span> had appeared in 1751, was dead; and his far
younger rival, Smollett, whose <span class='it'>Humphry Clinker</span> came
twenty years later, was also dead. Sterne was dead;
Goldsmith was dead; and both <span class='it'>Tristram Shandy</span> and
the <span class='it'>Vicar of Wakefield</span> had been a considerable time
before the public. Johnson, whose <span class='it'>Rasselas</span> dated
from 1759, and Horace Walpole, whose <span class='it'>Castle of Otranto</span>
dated from 1764, were the only living writers of fiction
of any eminence, for it is impossible to give a very
high place to the <span class='it'>Julia de Roubigné</span> of Sterne’s tearful
imitator, Henry Mackenzie, or to the <span class='it'>Champion of
Virtue</span>, which Walpole’s disciple, Miss Clara Reeve,
afterwards re-named <span class='it'>The Old English Baron</span>. Both of
these, however, belong to 1777. Apart from them,
there is nothing that rises above the average level

<p class='pindent'>Of these latter and minor performances, perhaps the
only one which—for the moment—deserves a passing
mention is the <span class='it'>Excursion</span> of Mrs. Frances Brooke,
already referred to in Chapter <span class='sc'>i.</span> as the popular author
of <span class='it'>Lady Julia Mandeville</span>. The <span class='it'>Excursion</span> has a certain
faint interest from the fact that, preceding <span class='it'>Evelina</span>
only by a few months, it deals, to some extent, with
a similar theme, since the heroine is described as “a
young lady of family but small fortune, with a mind
sensible and improved, but totally ignorant of the
world,” who “launches out from the country, steering,
without a pilot or compass, through the rocks
and shelves of a London life.” One of her perils is,
of course, a heartless young nobleman, educated by
his father “upon the detestable plan” of my Lord
Chesterfield, whose <span class='it'>Miscellaneous Works</span> had then just
been issued by Dr. Maty. Fanny Burney knew Mrs.
Brooke’s books, and had indeed made her personal
acquaintance, both in the studio of Miss Catherine
Reid, the “English Rosalba,” and at the Opera House
in the Haymarket, of which Mrs. Brooke was co-lessee
with the actress, Mary Ann Yates. “Mrs. Brooke
is very short and fat, and squints”—writes Fanny of
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>
their first interview, “but has the art of showing agreeable
ugliness. She is very well bred, and expresses
herself with much modesty upon all subjects; which
in an <span class='it'>authoress</span>, a woman of <span class='it'>known</span> understanding, is
extremely pleasing.” But save and except the very
superficial resemblance referred to above, there is no
trace of any connection between the <span class='it'>Excursion</span> and
<span class='it'>Evelina</span>. Indeed, as for the <span class='it'>Excursion</span>, although
Sylvanus Urban contrives to give it a review of two
or three columns,—a far longer notice than he afterwards,
and very tardily, accorded to <span class='it'>Evelina</span>,—it is
not more readable to-day than the same author’s <span class='it'>Lady
Julia Mandeville</span>, or her translations from the French,—that
is to say, it is not readable at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It has already been stated in Chapter <span class='sc'>i.</span>, that, amid
the fuel of Miss Burney’s Poland Street holocaust, was
“an entire work of fiction.” This was <span class='it'>The History of
Caroline Evelyn</span>, of which we know no more than is told
us in the Preface to <span class='it'>The Wanderer</span> and the <span class='it'>Memoirs of
Dr. Burney</span>. It was “the last of the little works that
was immolated,” and contained the history of Evelina’s
mother, who, as appears from the later novel dealing
with her daughter’s entrance into the world, was the
only child of a gentleman of birth and education
named Evelyn. Mr. Evelyn having been unwise
enough to marry a good-looking waitress at a tavern,
had in consequence migrated to France, where he
died. His daughter Caroline, after being brought up
carefully by his old tutor, the Rev. Mr. Villars, was
sent for to Paris by her vulgar mother, who, by this
time had married again, her second husband being a
Frenchman named Duval. Oppressed by Mme. Duval,
and menaced with an unsuitable partner, Miss Evelyn
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>
rashly consented to marry, without witnesses, a
profligate young baronet, Sir John Belmont, who
brought her back to England. Here after the approved
fashion of profligate young baronets in novels,
he, in due time, destroyed the marriage certificate,
denying that the ceremony had ever taken place.
His broken-hearted wife sought an asylum with her
old guardian, Mr. Villars, and subsequently died in
giving birth to Evelina.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such is the <span class='it'>History of Caroline Evelyn</span>, as it is summarised
in the opening letters of her daughter’s story;
and such, we may imagine, in expanded form, must have
been the matter of the manuscript which was burnt.
Whatever was the precise date of its destruction, it
must obviously have been a very juvenile performance.
It was certainly written before its author had begun
her Journal—in other words, before she had begun,
not only to record her thoughts and feelings, but to
take intelligent stock of the variations of humanity;
and it must also have been written before she had
been subjected to the discipline of acting as private
secretary to her father. As to the plot, there was
nothing in that beyond the ability of an imaginative
schoolgirl. Unfortunate heroine, heartless parent, profligate
baronet, private marriage, burnt certificate,—these
were the conventional material of contemporary
fiction, if indeed they did not come direct from
<span class='it'>Grandison</span> or <span class='it'>Clarissa</span>. What would be interesting to
know is, whether the <span class='it'>History of Caroline Evelyn</span> contained
any promise of character-drawing, still more of
social satire and humourous incident. We suspect it
did not. In all likelihood, it was merely a sentimental
exercise in the taste which then represented the degradation
<span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>
of the Richardsonian method, as modified by
French imitators; and perhaps aimed at nothing more
than mild rivalry of the existing biographies of <span class='it'>Miss
Polly Willis</span>, <span class='it'>Miss Lucy Wellers</span>, <span class='it'>Miss Charlotte Villars</span>, and
the rest of the ingenious works enumerated at the end
of the Preface to <span class='it'>Polly Honeycombe</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is no doubt that when Fanny Burney made
dutiful sacrifice of the <span class='it'>History of Caroline Evelyn</span>, she
sincerely intended, in her own words, “to extinguish
for ever in its ashes her scribbling propensity.” But
<span class='it'>qui a bu, boira</span>. As we have seen, the checked impulse
almost immediately found its outlet in keeping a
journal; and to keep a journal was but, in another
form, to exercise the prohibited gift and to gratify the
old ambition. The fire which “consumed her productions,
extirpated neither the invention nor the
inclination that had given them birth”; and, as time
went on, she felt herself more and more disposed to
revert to her first conception, and to brood over the
singular situation in which Miss Evelyn’s daughter
must find herself “between the elegant connections of
her mother, and the vulgar ones of her grandmother.”
Irresistibly and almost insensibly, she felt the whole
story forming itself gradually in her mind, and calling
urgently to be written down, long before a syllable
was committed to paper. When she actually began
to write, is not clear. It was in 1768 that the diary
opened; but there are no hints of the composition
of <span class='it'>Evelina</span> for some time to come. Probably it was
written by fits and starts; and grew but very
gradually into shape, making its greatest progress
during its writer’s visits to Chessington, or in the
leisure procured during her father’s two absences on
<span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>
the continent. And much of it was no doubt penned
in Newton’s old observatory, remote from her step-mother’s
watchful eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It must have been in 1776, after the publication of
the first volume of Dr. Burney’s <span class='it'>History of Music</span>, that
Fanny began definitely to think of print. Having
been long accustomed to act as secretary for her
father, she grew apprehensive lest her ordinary script
should be recognised at press; and she therefore proceeded
to transcribe her work “in a feigned hand.”
“The fear of discovery,” she writes, “or of suspicion
in the house, made the copying extremely laborious
to me; for in the daytime, I could only take odd
moments, so that I was obliged to sit up the greatest
part of many nights, in order to get it ready.” By
the time two volumes were completed, she was
sufficiently tired out—with “all this <span class='it'>fagging</span>”—to
wish to know whether her labour was likely to be in
vain. She accordingly wrote a letter to Dodsley of
Pall Mall, without signature, offering him what she
had already prepared, and promising to transmit the
remainder in the following year. The reply was to
be addressed to the Orange Coffee House in the Haymarket,
under cover to an imaginary “Mr. Grafton.”
Dodsley’s answer was to the effect that he could not
consider the work without being informed of the
author’s name. Thereupon Fanny, and her only confidantes,
her sisters, after sitting in committee upon
this discouraging reply, decided that it would be
wiser to try a less fashionable publisher. They fixed
upon Mr. Thomas Lowndes of 77 Fleet Street, who
expressed a desire to see the manuscript. It was
accordingly carried to Fleet Street, “in the dark of
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>
the evening,” by Fanny’s brother Charles, who, having
been admitted to the secret, was disguised for the
occasion by his sisters in appropriate costume. But
the bookseller’s reply, though one which might have
been expected, was a disappointment. Mr. Lowndes
informed his correspondent at the Orange Coffee House,
that, while (with some reservations) he approved the
instalment submitted, he could not think of printing
the book until it was finished; and that he would
consequently await the author’s pleasure, hoping to
receive it as soon as it was ready for type.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here was a blow which, for the moment, suspended
all further progress. “I had hardly time,” says
Fanny, “to write half a page in a day; and neither
my health nor inclination would allow me to continue
my <span class='it'>nocturnal</span> scribbling for so long a time, as to write
first, and then copy, a whole volume.”<a id='r30'/><a href='#f30' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[30]</span></sup></a> Nevertheless,
she must have gone on with it at intervals. In March,
1777, when, as already related, she went to Chessington,
she was certainly at work upon it. “Distant as
you may think us from the great world,” she writes to
her sister Susan, “I sometimes find myself in the
midst of it, though nobody suspects the brilliancy of
the company I occasionally keep.” This is a transparent
reference to the characters of the book upon
which she was engaged. In April, she went to
Worcester; and before starting, appears to have determined
that the time had arrived when she must
divulge her secret to her father. Hitherto she had
never taken any serious step without his knowledge;
and on this occasion had refrained from obtaining his
<span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>
concurrence, first from an unwillingness to acknowledge
her authorship, and secondly, from a dread that
he might ask to see what she had written. Upon this
latter head, however, she was speedily reassured.
Although Dr. Burney—who, we must remember, was
wholly without previous information on the subject—treated
the communication very lightly, he was
evidently surprised. In amused compliance with his
daughter’s urgent appeal for secrecy, he nevertheless
forbore even to ask the title of the book, or to make
any further enquiries. He only requested to be
informed, from time to time, of its progress towards
completion; and then left Fanny to follow her own
devices. Probably he thought no more of the matter.
Preoccupied with his own affairs, he can have attached
but slight importance to the intelligence conveyed to
him; and certainly never dreamed that his daughter’s
attempt would be attended with success. And so
Fanny, having liberated her mind, and eased her filial
conscience, set off for Worcester.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she got back to St. Martin’s Street, she
finished the preparation of vol. iii., which was handed
to Mr. Lowndes, who, in a few days, offered £20 for
the manuscript,—“an offer which was accepted with
alacrity, and boundless surprise at its magnificence,”
by the anonymous author.<a id='r31'/><a href='#f31' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[31]</span></sup></a> The next we hear of the
book is in the middle of January, 1778. About this
date, Edward Burney, the artist, who had been promoted
to the post of confidential agent in place of his
cousin Charles, then in the country, arrived with news
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>
that a parcel was waiting for “Mr. Grafton” at the
Orange Coffee House. It proved to contain a printed
but incomplete and unbound copy of <span class='it'>Evelina</span>, which
was accompanied by a letter from Mr. Lowndes,
requesting that a “List of Errata” might be supplied
without delay. This was accordingly done; and the
book was returned to the publisher, by whom, shortly
afterwards, it was advertised in the <span class='it'>London Chronicle</span>
for January 27-9, and elsewhere, as on sale, in three
volumes, 12mo, price 7s. 6d. sewed, and 9s. bound,
under the title of <span class='it'>Evelina; or, A Young Lady’s Entrance
into the World</span>. Mrs. Burney read out the announcement
at the St. Martin’s Street breakfast table; but,
being ignorant of the circumstances, naturally failed
to detect the signs of intelligence which passed between
Fanny and her sisters. Whether Dr. Burney was
present, is not recorded; but as he did not know the
name of the book, what was to its writer the earliest
notification of its public appearance would probably
have escaped his attention. For some weeks nothing
more was heard of the matter, although, in March, the
sisters and their cousin Edward, making enquiry at
Bell’s Library in the Strand, found that <span class='it'>Evelina</span> was in
circulation; and that, as Fanny puts it, “a work which
was so lately lodged, in all privacy in her bureau, was
now to be seen by every butcher and baker, cobbler and
tinker, throughout the three kingdoms for the small
tribute of three pence.” After this, Dr. Burney fell
ill of fever. Having helped to nurse him, Fanny herself
had inflammation of the lungs; and, in May, went
off to Chessington to recruit. It was at Chessington
that she received, at this late hour, the first copy of
her book, for which she had hitherto applied unsuccessfully
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>
to Mr. Lowndes. He now forwarded a set
“most elegantly bound” (which may be taken as an
indication that it was growing in popularity), and this
copy was apparently followed by ten further copies.
Some time, however, was still to elapse before <span class='it'>Evelina</span>
became thoroughly well known, and we may occupy
the interval with an examination of its contents.<a id='r32'/><a href='#f32' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[32]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>The plot is neither very original nor very intricate.
With the parentage and early history of the heroine,
Evelina Anville or, more properly, Belmont, the reader
has already been made acquainted. At the beginning
of the story, her low-born grandmother, Mme. Duval,
having ignored her for seventeen years, has begun to
show disquieting signs of seeking to obtain control
over her, much to the dismay of her guardian, the
excellent Mr. Villars. But nothing happens until
Mr. Villars, having permitted Evelina to visit his
and her friend, Lady Howard, at Howard Grove, is
unwillingly persuaded to let her accompany Lady
Howard’s daughter, Mrs. Mirvan, on a visit to London.
Mrs. Mirvan is going to town to meet her husband, a
Captain in the Navy, newly returned from a seven-years’
absence on a distant station. They take lodgings in
Queen-Anne-Street, Cavendish Square. From this point
Evelina mainly holds the pen. Almost as a matter of
course, one of the first persons they encounter is Mme.
Duval, travelling with a Frenchman named Du Bois.
(Du Bois, it may be mentioned in parenthesis, was
the name of Fanny’s Huguenot grandfather.) To
Mrs. Mirvan’s aristocratic acquaintances, Mme. Duval
speedily opposes her own vulgar connections, the
<span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>
Branghtons, a silversmith’s family on Snow-Hill, with
whom, in due time, originates the suggestion that
“Miss,” as they call Evelina, shall endeavour to obtain
recognition by her father,—an idea which obviously
has its source in their desire to secure Mme. Duval’s
fortune for themselves. At the instance of Mme.
Duval, then staying at Howard Grove, Lady Howard
writes to Sir John Belmont, who returns an answer
from the studious ambiguity of which it is impossible
to extract anything but a rather contemptuous negative.
The Mirvans, who have been temporising with
Mme. Duval in order to keep Evelina with them as
long as possible, are now obliged to surrender her for
a time to her objectionable grandmother, by whom she
is carried to London and her Snow-Hill cousins.
Eventually she returns to Mr. Villars. But during
her stay in Holborn, she has become acquainted with
one of the Branghtons’ lodgers, a young Scotchman in
destitute circumstances, named Macartney, whom she
saves from suicide. In Paris Macartney has fallen
in love with a beautiful English girl, the alleged
daughter of a baronet, who turns out to be Sir John
Belmont himself. This girl is a certain Bessie Green,
who has been palmed off upon his paternal remorse
as Caroline Evelyn’s child. Finally, at Bath, things
come right. While Evelina is there on a visit, her
father arrives to drink the waters, accompanied by
the pseudo-Miss Belmont. But Evelina’s striking
resemblance to her dead mother is unmistakable; she
is at once acknowledged by Sir John Belmont with
appropriate heroics, and at the close of volume three,
bestows her hand upon Lord Orville, the best of a
fair number of eligible and ineligible suitors.
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>This, reduced to an outline, is the plot of Miss
Burney’s story; and that it has any special novelty of
construction, can scarcely be contended. Nor, although
she has adopted the “epistolary Style” of Richardson,
can it be said to bear any great likeness to the work
of that master. There is no endeavour after mental
analysis; or—it may be added—any obtrusive evidence
of prolixity. The book does not, like the
novels of Fielding and Smollett, deal with humanity
in the rough; but rather with humanity in the circumscribed
arena of domestic life. Its distinctive
merit consists in the skill and graphic power of the
character drawing; in the clever contrast of the
different individualities; in the author’s keen if somewhat
crude sense of the ridiculous; and, above all, in
the sprightliness and vivacity of her narrative, especially
when she writes in the person of the heroine.
And this last, in great measure, is due to the fact that
in Evelina Miss Burney has portrayed her younger self.
Until the publication of the <span class='it'>Early Diary</span>, this, though
conjectured, was not clearly established. But a perusal
of the letters to Mr. Crisp, of the Teignmouth and
Worcester Journals, and of half a dozen of the reported
conversations, shows clearly that Evelina Anville,
narrating her adventures to Mr. Villars, was using
very much the same pen as Frances Burney had employed
for those <span class='it'>nouvelles à-la-main</span> which, from time
to time, she despatched to “Daddy” Crisp at Chessington.
The writer who describes the theatricals at
Barborne Lodge, or recounts the long conversations
with Mr. Barlow, is precisely the same person who, in
the novel, reproduces the small talk in the tea-room
at the Pantheon, or records the rough-and-tumble
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>
misadventures of Mme. Duval at Ranelagh. All these
people and places Miss Burney had seen; or if she had
not, it needed little but her perceptive faculty, her
sense of humour, and her dramatising gift, to enable
her to invent similar characters, and exhibit them in
action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is possible, of course, that, in some cases, Miss
Burney leaned upon her predecessors, especially where
her own experiences fell short. Lord Orville, it has
been suggested, is a recollection of the hero of <span class='it'>Sir
Charles Grandison</span>; Sir Clement Willoughby, of Sir
Hargrave Pollexfen or Mr. Greville in the same novel.
That she should think of these then-established types
would, indeed, be only natural. But while Richardson
drew his male heroes mainly from his moral consciousness,
Miss Burney has rectified her puppets from her
personal recollections. Lord Orvilles, perhaps, were
not very common in her environment. Still, to say
nothing of King in Lord Ogleby (she knew the
<span class='it'>Clandestine Marriage</span> by heart), she had seen and heard
a live fine gentleman in Fulke Greville; and in Mr.
Anthony Chamier and Mr. Charles Boone had conversed
with some flesh-and-blood specimens of men
of the world, who helped to make her characters,
objectively at all events, more convincingly real than
those of Richardson. For Lord Orville—though
somewhat shadowy—is really a nobleman; and Sir
Clement Willoughby, a not-inconceivable specimen of
the <span class='it'>genus</span> “agreeable rake.” As to the impertinent
fop, Mr. Lovel, one can imagine that she would have
little difficulty in constructing him—with an added
sprinkle of malice—out of the “scraps and heel-taps”
of her coxcomb cousin, Richard Burney of Worcester,
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>
or of that other fantastic feather-head, the Spanish
traveller, Mr. Twiss. But the Lovels, and the Orvilles,
and the Willoughbys, clever as they are, would scarcely
have made the fortune of <span class='it'>Evelina</span>; still less would
the benedictory Mr. Villars, the exemplary Lady
Howard, Mrs. Mirvan and her daughter, or that
melancholy concession to sentimentalism, Mr. Macartney.
These belong to the working machinery of
the story; its prominent interest, apart from its
accurate pictures of contemporary character and
manners, is concentrated upon the two antagonists,
Captain Mirvan and Mme. Duval, and upon the
inimitably vulgar Branghton group, which includes
the Holborn beau, Mr. Smith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Duval, in particular, is drawn with
remarkable vigour, though it is difficult to imagine
how, at any period of her life, an educated man could
possibly have married her. Her illiterate English
with its cheap French tags, her <span class='it'>Ma fois</span> and her
Shakespearean superlatives, all combine to make a
most graphic broad-comedy portrait. She would
perhaps have been better for a touch, which Goldsmith
would certainly not have omitted, of tenderness somewhere;
as it is, the only sign of anything approaching
that quality is her solicitude for M. Du Bois, the poor
French gentleman who accompanies her,—one hardly
knows why,—for he has no very definite purpose in the
book beyond swelling the list of Evelina’s admirers,
and opposing his courtesy and unobtrusive good manners
to the rudeness of his immediate associates. But
though no softer traits make us admire Mme. Duval,
one can at least be sorry for her. A certain amount
of horse-play—and even the ruining of a new Lyons
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>
silk costume—are perhaps permissible in a roaring
farce; but to drag an elderly woman forcibly along
the high road, shake her furiously, deposit her in a
ditch (bumping her vigorously the while), and then
tie her feet together, leaving her “almost roaring, and
in the utmost agony of rage and terror”—certainly
seems to be going to unusual lengths in the pursuit
of practical joking, even with a person who has
so far forgotten herself as to spit in your face. If
Mme. Duval was not a person of “position” in one
sense, she was at least (as the Colonel says in <span class='it'>Punch</span>)
a person of exceedingly “uncomfortable position”
in another. Yet, as Miss Burney has depicted the
episode, we must presume that she has actually
depicted something she had heard of or seen. And
there is no doubt that there was an under side to the
often superficial and conventional refinement of her
day,—a side of absolute heartlessness and insensibility,
begotten of brutal pastimes, butcherly penal laws, and
a cynical disregard for the value of human life. Even
in that admirable comedy of Goldsmith which Miss
Burney had seen played not so very many years before
the appearance of <span class='it'>Evelina</span>, there are traces of this,
though Goldsmith was the most amiable of men. Yet
even Goldsmith allows Tony Lumpkin to tell an audience
that, after jolting two ladies, one of them his
own mother, to a jelly, he has finally lodged them in
a horsepond; and everyone seems to think the joke
an excellent one. Nor are there any indications that
Johnson or Reynolds ever commented upon the callous
barbarity of the proceeding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This being so, we could perhaps hardly expect any
superfine delicacy from the rough sailor whom Miss
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>
Burney has invented for Mme. Duval’s discomfiture.
Captain Mirvan is an officer of the Oakum and Hatchway
type rather than of the Lieutenant Bowling order.
His twin aversions are a fop and a Frenchman; and
he meets them both; or rather, in place of the latter,
he meets an Englishwoman naturalised in France,
which does as well. Indeed, it is a little curious that,
in his hatred of “Madam Frog,” as he calls Evelina’s
grandmother, Captain Mirvan entirely overlooks the
fact that Mme. Duval is really nothing more than a
vulgar English barmaid. Captain Mirvan is excellently
conceived, but only partially exhibited. To
say nothing of the fact that he is a seaman on
shore, it would have been impossible for Evelina to
depict him except in expurgated form. She herself
allows as much to Mr. Villars. “Notwithstanding
the attempts I so frequently make of writing some
of the Captain’s conversation, I can only give you
a faint idea of his language; for almost every other
word he utters, is accompanied by an oath, which, I
am sure, would be as unpleasant for you to read,
as for me to write. And, besides, he makes use of
a thousand sea-terms, which are to me quite unintelligible.”
Miss Burney had a brother who was a
lieutenant in the navy, and no doubt was sufficiently
instructed as to the manners and customs of the
mariners of Cook’s day. She moreover appreciated
to the full their delight in hoaxes and practical jokes.
As regards their oaths and asseverations no one can
blame her reticence,—a reticence which was commended
even by her contemporaries. But it is permissible
to criticism to observe that a Georgian
ship-captain <span class='it'>ad usum Delphini</span>, and deprived in great
<span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>
measure of his picturesque nautical jargon is an
artistic contradiction which it is difficult to invest
with complete and convincing reality. It is no
doubt owing in part to the absence of his uncouth
amphibious atmosphere that Captain Mirvan’s baiting
of Mme. Duval leaves such an unpleasantly cold-blooded
impression upon the modern reader. On
ship-board, and in his own element, he was no doubt
a brave man and a smart officer. On shore, he is an
unmitigated bear; and since Mme. Duval was in a
way his guest, an absolutely inconceivable host.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the Branghton family, Miss Burney has given,
at the outset, a rather fuller introductory description
than she usually gives of her characters. The father,
Mme. Duval’s nephew, is a silversmith on Snow-Hill,
a man about forty, intelligent, but contracted and
prejudiced, having spent his life in the city, and contemptuous
of all who reside elsewhere. His son is
“weaker in his understanding, and more gay in his
temper; but his gaiety is that of a foolish, over-grown
schoolboy, whose mirth consists in noise and disturbance.
He disdains his father for his close attention
to business, and love of money; though he seems himself
to have no talents, spirit, or generosity, to make
him superior to either. His chief delight appears to
be tormenting and ridiculing his sisters, who, in
return, most heartily despise him.” The elder girl
is not ill-looking; but is proud, ill-tempered and conceited.
“She hates the city, though without knowing
why; for it is easy to discover she has lived no where
else.” The younger sister, Polly, is “rather pretty,
very foolish, very ignorant, very giddy and very good
natured.” This worshipful family, after the fashion
<span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>
of the eighteenth century, live at the shop in the city,
and let some of the rooms. One of the garrets is
occupied by the already mentioned Scotch poet, Macartney,
while the dining room is in possession of the
Holborn beau, who, besides keeping a foot-boy of his
own, is—according to Miss Polly Branghton—“quite
like one of the quality, and dresses as fine, and goes
to balls and dances, and everything quite in taste.”
Mr. Smith, with his underbred gentility and his
awkward sprightliness, is the most vivid of the
portraits in the book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With enforced associates of this type, it is easy
to conceive that Evelina is continually involved in
vexation and embarrassment, and even landed in some
equivocal situations. The Branghtons take her to
the Opera, but carry her to the shilling gallery. They
take her to Vauxhall, where, unlike Goldsmith’s pawnbroker’s
widow, she <span class='it'>does</span> contrive to see the famous
waterworks. But by the heedlessness of her cousins,
she is decoyed into the dubious Dark Walks, where
she is rescued from a gang of rakes by Sir Clement
Willoughby, only to be subsequently subjected by
him to impertinent gallantries on his own account.
After this, she goes to a ball at the Long Room at
Hampstead with Mme. Duval, where she has the
greatest difficulty in avoiding to “hop a dance” with
the importunate Holborn beau, who, in the phrase of
his circle is “as fine as fivepence.” At Marylebone
Gardens an explosion of M. Torré’s fireworks terrifies
her into seeking the protection of some very undesirable
companions of her own sex, in whose compromising
company, to her intense annoyance, she is
discovered both by Lord Orville and Sir Clement
<span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span>
Willoughby. Finally, after she has been pestered
by the attentions of Mr. Smith, and threatened by
Mme. Duval with young Branghton as a husband,
the full measure of her mortification is filled at
Kensington Gardens, where, in a soaking shower, her
cousins contrive to borrow Lord Orville’s coach, in
her name, although against her will. As a result the
coach is badly injured in taking these discreditable
connections to Snow Hill. There are other consequences
to this misadventure, but they cannot be
touched upon here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These scenes at the old London pleasure resorts of
Evelina’s century—as was admitted by her contemporaries—are
depicted with full knowledge, and with
a spirit and animation not to be found elsewhere,
though it is difficult to make quotation from them
without presenting them imperfectly. One passage,
however, which Johnson admired, we may venture to
cite, with the <span class='it'>caveat</span> that a brick is not a building.
The party are in the Great Room at Vauxhall, looking
at one of Hayman’s paintings;—we may assume it,
from the reference to Neptune, to be that which commemorated
Admiral Hawke’s defeat of the French in
Quiberon Bay. Evelina has asked M. Du Bois for an
explanation of the subject: Mme. Duval invokes the
assistance of Mr. Smith, who, for the moment, is sorely
crestfallen at the superior ease and splendour of Sir
Clement Willoughby:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Don’t ask him [M. Du Bois]’—she cries—‘your
best way is to ask Mr. Smith, for he’s been here the
oftenest. Come, Mr. Smith, I daresay you can tell us
all about them.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Why, yes, Ma’am, yes,’ said Mr. Smith: who,
<span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>
brightening up at this application, advanced towards
us, with an air of assumed importance, which, however,
sat very uneasily upon him, and begged to know what
he should explain first: ‘For I have attended,’ said
he, ‘to all these paintings, and know everything in
them perfectly well; for I am rather fond of pictures,
Ma’am; and, really, I must say, I think a pretty
picture is a—a very—is really a very—is something
very pretty——’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘So do I too,’ said Madame Duval, ‘but pray now,
Sir, tell us who that is meant for,’ pointing to a figure
of Neptune.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘That!—Why, that, Ma’am, is,— .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I can’t
think how I come to be so stupid, but really I have
forgot his name;—and yet, I know it as well as my
own too,—however, he’s a <span class='it'>General</span>, Ma’am, they are all
Generals.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw Sir Clement bite his lips; and, indeed, so
did I mine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well,’ said Madame Duval, ‘it’s the oddest dress
for a general ever I see!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘He seems so capital a figure,’ said Sir Clement to
Mr. Smith, ‘that I imagine he must be <span class='it'>Generalissimo</span> of
the whole army.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Yes, Sir, yes,’ answered Mr. Smith, respectfully
bowing, and highly delighted at being thus referred
to, ‘you are perfectly right;—but I cannot for my life
think of his name;—perhaps, Sir, you may remember
it?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘No, really,’ replied Sir Clement, ‘my acquaintance
among the generals is not so extensive.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The ironical tone of voice in which Sir Clement
spoke, entirely disconcerted Mr. Smith; who again
<span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>
retiring to a humble distance, seemed sensibly mortified
at the failure of the attempt to recover his
consequence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After volume two, we hear little of Mme. Duval
or the Branghtons; and Captain Mirvan only appears
at the end of the book for the exposure of the
fop, Mr. Lovel, which he accomplishes with his customary
cruelty. Croker thought this latter part
“very tedious,” but his objection was not shared by
Miss Burney’s first readers. There are, it is true, no
characters in it as broadly drawn as Captain Mirvan
and Mme. Duval; but those that are new, have all
the trick of the time. Lord Merton and Mr. Coverley
are typical examples of the Georgian man of pleasure,
and the race of old women by which they settle their
wager, could easily, painful as it seemed to the lookers-on,
have been paralleled from the annals of the day.
Indeed, something of the kind was devised by Garrick
for the diversions of his Hampton Villa. Lady Louisa
Larpent is an excellent specimen of the die-away,
lackadaisical lady of quality who must have abounded
at the old watering places, while the remorseless Mrs.
Selwyn, secure in her age and independent means, and
devoting herself entirely to the reckless gratification
of her caustic humour, is again a thoroughly recognisable
society type. In fact, these latter personages
are truer to the social conditions of the day than
even “Madam French” and the Captain, and only
failed of equal applause because they were less novel.
So far from being tedious, the last volume seems to
us the most easily written. The intrigue, slight as
it is, is artfully entangled, and the style has the
additional freedom which might be expected from
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>
the fact that there was now a definite publisher in
sight, as soon as the work should be brought to
an end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Prefixed to <span class='it'>Evelina</span> is a votive poem of five quatrains,
a “Dedication addressed to the Authors of the <span class='it'>Monthly</span>
and <span class='it'>Critical Reviews</span>,” and a Preface. The verses,
although headed “To **** *****,” are of course
intended for Dr. Burney.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<div class='literal-container' style=''><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“Oh! of my life at once the source and joy!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;If e’er thy eyes these feeble lines survey,</p>
<p class='line0'>Let not their folly their intent destroy;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Accept the tribute—but forget the lay”—</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>they conclude, and it would be idle to pretend that
their affection is not more manifest than their poetical
merit. The “Dedication” and the “Preface,” on the
contrary, are well invented; and moreover, shew plainly
that, in serious or impersonal prose, the Johnsonian
standard, afterwards so obtrusive in the writer’s work,
was already present to her mind. Speaking, in the
Preface, of her predecessors in fiction, she says, “I yet
presume not to attempt pursuing the same ground which
they have tracked; whence, though they may have
cleared the weeds, they have also culled the flowers;
and, though they have rendered the path plain, they
have left it barren.” Again, “Whatever may be the fate
of these letters, the writer is satisfied they will meet
with justice; and commends them to the press, though
hopeless of fame, yet not regardless of censure.” These
are sentences which, with their balanced turn, and contrast
of clauses, might have come direct from <span class='it'>Rasselas</span>
or the <span class='it'>Rambler</span>. The same Preface contains a passage
to which we are probably indebted for much of that old
<span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span>
persistent misconception as to the author’s age, of which
Croker (“no one could lash a woman like Rigby!”)
made such paltry capital. “To draw characters from
nature, though not from life, and to mark the manners
of the times, is the attempted plan of the following
letters. For this purpose, a young female, educated
in the most secluded retirement, makes, <span class='it'>at the age of
seventeen</span> [the italics are ours], her first appearance upon
the great and busy stage of life.” Here, no doubt,
is the source and origin of the story which Croker
had “always seen and heard stated.” To any unprejudiced
mind, it must be obvious that Miss Burney
is referring, not to her own age, but to that of her
heroine; and this is confirmed—if confirmation were
needed—by her Diary. “I have not pretended,” she
writes in March, 1778, “to shew the world what it
actually is, but what it <span class='it'>appears</span> to a girl of seventeen:—and
so far as that, surely any girl who is <span class='it'>past</span> seventeen
may safely do?” And yet, as late as 1871, a
critic was found to quote the words of the “Preface”
and to contend, in Croker’s interest, that Miss Burney
was speaking of herself.<a id='r33'/><a href='#f33' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[33]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>The first of the Reviews to answer the appeal in the
Dedication was not either of those to which the author
had referred. In the <span class='it'>London Review</span> for February there
was a tiny notice of three lines. But, considering that
it came from, or was approved by, the critic whom
Macaulay stigmatises as the “envious Kenrick,” it was
not unfriendly. “There was much more merit” in
Evelina’s history, it said, “as well respecting style,
character and incident, than was generally to be found
<span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>
among our modern novels.” The <span class='it'>Monthly Review</span> (Mr.
Ralph Griffiths) was the next to take up the book,
making its report in April. This was not long; but
it was excellent. It pronounced <span class='it'>Evelina</span> to be “one
of the most sprightly, entertaining, and agreeable productions”
of the kind which had of late fallen under
its notice. It praised the “great variety of natural incidents,”
and declared the characters to be “agreeably
diversified, conceived and drawn with propriety, and
supported with spirit.” “The whole,” it went on, “is
written with great ease, and command of language.
From this commendation, however, we must except
the character of a son of Neptune, whose manners are
rather those of a rough uneducated country squire,
than those of a genuine sea captain.” For the <span class='it'>Critical
Review</span> Miss Burney had to wait until September, when
Sylvanus Urban also joined the concert. The notice
in the <span class='it'>Critical Review</span> was the longest of all. It compared
the writer with Richardson. It considered the
first and third volumes to be the best, and it praised
Mme. Duval and Captain Mirvan as, in great measure,
original. With respect to the author, whom it speaks
of as “he,” it was still wholly in the dark; and it
commended the knowledge of the world and the experience
of life which the book contained. Mr. Urban
contented himself with a long extract from the “Preface,”
and concluded, “Such is the just account given
of this work by the author; to which we shall only
add that these vols. will afford a pleasing innocent
amusement, exhibiting, in an easy style, many such
characters as occur in the world, not raised so high as
to be extravagant, nor sunk so low as to be disgusting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is no definite evidence that Miss Burney had
<span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>
any knowledge either of Kenrick’s or Griffiths’ review,
when, in May, she went to Chessington. While she
was at “Daddy” Crisp’s—as already related—the first
bound copy was received from Lowndes. But those
in the secret had kept it well, and it was not until
June that it was really revealed. In March, Fanny’s
cousin Richard, recovering from an illness, had heard
<span class='it'>Evelina</span> read aloud, and was taken into confidence;
while in May, his sister Bessy, one of the actors in
the Worcester theatricals, had, in her own phrase,
“smoked” Fanny in the new book, which was beginning
to be talked about. But Fanny’s father, to whom
<span class='it'>Evelina</span> was dedicated, was still wholly ignorant of the
matter, and his diffident daughters did not dare to
undeceive him. At last, at the beginning of June,
Charlotte writes jubilantly that Papa has been looking
at the review in the <span class='it'>Monthly</span>, and has bought a copy
of <span class='it'>Evelina</span>. He has been much affected by the <span class='it'>Ode</span>,
and is reading the book to Lady Hales and another
friend. He thinks the Preface and Dedication “<span class='it'>vastly
strong and well written</span>,” Susan reports to the author.
The account of public places (he declares) is “very
animated, and natural, and not <span class='it'>common</span>”; and in his
opinion, Lowndes has had a very good bargain. By
June 16 he has finished it. It is “the best novel he
knows,” says the proud father, “excepting Fielding’s,”
and in some respects it is better even than his. His
only objection is to Mirvan’s treatment of Lovel, which
is “a brutality which does not make one laugh.”
Villars and Lord Orville he admired greatly; and he
has “blubbered” over the scenes at the end between
Evelina and Sir John Belmont. As to his lady
auditors, they are still crying. For Fanny’s sake
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>
(“Poor Fan’s <span class='it'>such</span> a prude”), he will keep the secret
snug; but he evidently does not apprehend that its
disclosure would bring her any discredit. “For a
young woman’s work, I look upon it to be really
<span class='sc'>wonderful</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this Susan Burney recapitulates with abundant
decorative detail to the delighted author at Chessington,
whose foremost anxiety had been as to her
father’s opinion. She herself has been reading the
book aloud to Mr. Crisp, who, good, easy man, has no
suspicions, but is interested, and tantalised into greater
curiosity by having to wait patiently for the successive
volumes. Presently <span class='it'>Evelina</span> is recommended by a lady
to Mrs. Thrale, who “likes it <span class='sc'>vastly</span>—is <span class='sc'>extremely</span>
pleased with it.” Whatever human <span class='it'>nature</span> there may
be in Mme. Riccoboni,<a id='r34'/><a href='#f34' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[34]</span></sup></a> she tells Mrs. Burney, who has
been praising that writer, there is human <span class='it'>life</span> in <span class='it'>Evelina</span>,
and the manners of the time. “It’s writ (she says)
by somebody that knows <span class='it'>the top and the bottom</span>, the
<span class='it'>highest</span> and <span class='it'>lowest</span> of mankind.” Thereupon Mrs. Burney
borrows it to read; and long letters go off to Fanny
embodying the remarks of both parents over the
book as they study it slowly in bed in the morning.
Finally, as Dr. Burney has obtained Fanny’s leave to
tell Mrs. Thrale, Mrs. Burney also has to be told.
And then—crown of all things!—comes a congratulatory
letter from Mrs. Thrale herself, praising <span class='it'>Evelina</span>
for “probability of story, elegance of sentiment, and
<span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>
general power over the mind, whether exerted in
humour or pathos.” But “the cream of the correspondence,”
as Tony Lumpkin calls it, is not for once
in a postscript. It is in the middle. Dr. <span class='sc'>Johnson</span>
has read the first two volumes, and protests there are
“passages in the book which might do honour to
Richardson.” He is hungering for the <span class='it'>dénoûment</span>,
and is now hard at work on volume three. This
astounding intelligence has such an effect upon the
author that, in her own words, “it almost crazed her
with agreeable surprise.” It gave her such a flight
of spirits that she then and there “danced a jigg to
Mr. Crisp, without any preparation, music, or explanation,—to
his no small amazement, and diversion.”
She was an expert emulator of the light-heeled Nancy
Dawson; and the scene of this impromptu performance—as
she told Sir Walter Scott forty-eight years
afterwards—was a mulberry tree in the garden at
Chessington.<a id='r35'/><a href='#f35' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[35]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>“Daddy” Crisp was now almost the only person out
of the secret; and he had to be enlightened. Dr.
Burney took this duty upon himself when he came
down to Chessington in August to fetch away his
daughter; and the old man’s pride and surprise and
delight were unbounded.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER IV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE SUCCESSFUL AUTHOR</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'>Once—so runs the story—when Miss Burney was
dining with Sir Joshua Reynolds at that pleasant villa
upon Richmond Hill which had been built for him by
Chambers the architect, she chanced to see him looking
at her in a peculiar way. “I know what you are
thinking about,”—she said. “Ay,” he replied, “you
may come and sit to me now whenever you please.”
He had at last caught her special attitude,—her distinctive
phase. “I hope he will take your picture,”
“Daddy” Crisp had said, when she first made the
artist’s acquaintance;—“who knows, but the time may
come when your image may appear .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. like Garrick
with the Comic and Tragic Muse contending for you?”
Thalia and Melpomene were certainly to contend for
the author of <span class='it'>Evelina</span>, and that at no distant date.
There is however no picture of Fanny Burney in the
Reynolds Gallery. Hoppner painted her later; but
Hoppner is not Sir Joshua. Her best likeness, one of
two from the same hand, is by her cousin, Edward
Burney, who, it is hinted, surveyed his model—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<div class='literal-container' style=''><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;“in the light</p>
<p class='line0'>Of tender personal regards,”—</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>and—it is also hinted—possibly slightly flattered her.
<span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Edward Burney’s portrait, which is prefixed to the
<span class='it'>Diary and Letters</span> of 1842-6, had been mezzotinted two
years earlier by Charles Turner on a larger scale. It
is said to represent Miss Burney at the age of thirty,
having been painted at Chessington in August 1782.
She wears a hat and feathers; and her hair is frizzed
out in the approved fashion of the day. Her attitude
is conventional:—she sits demurely erect, with formally
posed hands. But her eyes are brimming with latent
animation; and the corners of the lips are lifted with a
lurking sense of fun. Of the sitter’s stature the picture
gives little indication. She is reported, however, to
have been extremely slight and frail of make—“a small
cargo for the Chessington coach,” said Mr. Crisp. It
was perhaps owing to this that she preserved so long
her youthful and almost girlish appearance. As to her
eyes, which, in the portrait, look large and luminous, we
have her own assurance that they were greenish gray;
and from the fact that she was called “the dove” by
one of her Tunbridge friends, we must assume that
they resembled those of Mrs. Delany, who is praised
by her adoring husband for “what Solomon calls
‘dove’s eyes.’ ” Her complexion was brown; and she is
affirmed to have been rather French-looking. Beautiful
of feature, perhaps, she could scarcely be called.
But it is admitted that she had great charm of expression,
and a countenance which was quick to betray
every passing emotion. “Poor Fanny’s face”—said
her father—“tells us what she thinks whether she will
or no”; and she confirms this herself by lamenting her
lack of power to command her features. She “rouged”
readily—to use her own euphemism for blushing. For
the rest, she was all her life ailing and delicate. But
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>
like many valetudinarians, she succeeded in surviving
her robuster relatives. She out-lasted all her sisters
except one; and she lived to the age of eighty-seven.<a id='r36'/><a href='#f36' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[36]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>When Dr. Burney fetched his daughter from Chessington,
it had been arranged that they should stop at
Streatham Place on their way back to town. This they
did; and Fanny’s diary gives a full account of what
she pronounces to be “the most consequential day she
had spent since her birth.” Mrs. Thrale was very
gracious, and very discreet, only mentioning <span class='it'>Evelina</span> in
order to refer to Dr. Johnson’s genuine admiration for
the book. Mr. Seward, whom we remember as one of
the visitors to St. Martin’s Street, was not by any
means so considerate, bluntly blurting out his praises
in the most embarrassing manner. At dinner a place
was left next Miss Burney for Dr. Johnson, who presently
appeared. The Doctor was as delicate as Mrs.
Thrale, only touching indirectly and circuitously upon
the burning topic. Asked by Mrs. Thrale to have
some little pies of mutton, he declared gallantly
that sitting next Miss Burney made him too proud to
eat mutton. Later, after some rambling talk about
the wear and tear of Garrick’s face, he went on to
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>
speak of Dr. Burney’s rival, Sir John Hawkins, whom
he can scarcely be said to have extolled. He believed
him “an honest man at the bottom; but to be
sure,” he continued, “he is penurious, and he is mean,
and it must be owned he has a degree of brutality, and
a tendency to savageness, that cannot easily be defended.”
Giving an instance of Sir John’s “<span class='it'>unclubbable</span>”
character, he added that it reminded him of a lady
with whom he had once travelled, who, stopping at
an inn in her own coach and four, called for—a pint
of ale! quarrelling moreover with the waiter for not
giving full measure. And here came in another adroit
allusion to <span class='it'>Evelina</span>. “Mme. Duval”—said the Doctor—“could
not have done a grosser thing!”—a sentiment
which of course convulsed the company, and threw the
young person at his side into the most delicious confusion.
Altogether the visit was delightful; and when
Fanny and her father got into the chaise to go, it was
a settled thing that she was to come again to Streatham,
and for a much longer stay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she reached St. Martin’s Street, there were
further honours in store for her. Hetty had lately
met Frances Reynolds, who was full of the new novel,
“though without a shadow of suspicion as to the
scribbler.” This, of itself, was not much; but Miss
Reynolds also announced that her brother, Sir Joshua,
having begun it when “he was too much engaged to go
on with it, was so much caught, that he could think of
nothing else, and was quite absent all the day, not
knowing a word that was said to him; and, when he
took it up again, found himself so much interested in it,
that he sat up all night to finish it!” He would give
fifty pounds, he had subsequently declared, to know
<span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>
the author, and other people were equally inquisitive.
After this interesting piece of intelligence, Fanny
thought she would herself go to Mr. Thomas Lowndes,
and ascertain in what way that gentleman was satisfying
the eagerness of enquirers. As she could not
trust herself to speak, her step-mother went with her.
They began by buying a copy, and then asked Mr.
Lowndes—a pompous and consequential personage
who happened to be in the shop—if he could tell them
who wrote it. No, he replied, he did not know himself.
Pressed further, he said that the author was a
gentleman of the other end of the town; and, in
response to renewed cross-questioning on Mrs. Burney’s
part, affirmed that he was a master of his subject, and
well versed in the manners of the times. Moreover,
that he (Mr. Lowndes) had at first thought <span class='it'>Evelina</span> was
by Horace Walpole, who had once published a book in
the same “snug manner,”<a id='r37'/><a href='#f37' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[37]</span></sup></a> but he did not think so
now. (Other people, it may be noted, had attributed
it to Christopher Anstey of the <span class='it'>New Bath Guide</span>, then
some dozen years old,—a work which Miss Anville
and Lord Orville peruse together at Mrs. Beaumont’s.)
Finally, out of sheer inability to satisfy his interrogator,
Mr. Lowndes hinted darkly, “with a most
important face,” that he had been told that the authorship
of <span class='it'>Evelina</span> was a piece of real secret history, which
could consequently never be known. This final piece
of information was too much for the listener, who
“was obliged to look out at the shop-door” for the
remainder of the interview. To the modern student
Fanny’s investigations would have been more satisfying
<span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>
if they had thrown some definite light on the progress
of the book from the publisher’s point of view. In
spite of various statements to the contrary, it seems
clear that when, in August, 1778, she and her step-mother
went to Fleet Street, Mr. Lowndes was still
selling the first impression. The second edition is
dated 1779; and in October, 1796, the author wrote
that “the first edition of <span class='it'>Evelina</span> was of eight hundred,
the second of five hundred, and the third of a thousand”
copies. On the other hand, Lowndes, who should certainly
have been acquainted with the facts, informed
Dr. Burney, in an unpublished letter of 1782, that he
only printed a first edition of five hundred. Whichever
be the correct version of the story, it is pretty
clear that the sale for the first twelve months can
scarcely be regarded as extraordinary.<a id='r38'/><a href='#f38' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[38]</span></sup></a>
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Before the end of August Mrs. Thrale called at St.
Martin’s Street, and carried off her new friend to
Streatham Place; and at Streatham Place Fanny
practically remained for the rest of 1778. The inviting
white house with its wooded park, or enclosure,
where—to use Susan Burney’s expression—the “cattle,
poultry, and dogs all ran freely about without annoying
each other,” has now long been a thing of the past,
having been pulled down in 1863. Its site was the
southern side of the lower common between Streatham
and Tooting. It was a three-storied building, with
many cheerful rooms which Fanny’s records make
familiar to us. The saloon was hung with sky blue;
and there was a parlour for the more crowded dinner
parties, decorated with prints by Hogarth and others
which, probably inaccurately, are described as being
“pasted” on the walls. The library, also used frequently
as a breakfast room, had been built by
Mr. Thrale about 1773, and was kept stocked with
books by Johnson, who here—said Mrs. Thrale—“talked
Ramblers,” while she read aloud the last
proofs of the <span class='it'>Lives of the Poets</span>. Above the book-cases,
hung the famous Thrale Gallery, dispersed in 1816,—portraits
by Sir Joshua of Johnson, of Burke, of the
artist himself, of Goldsmith, Garrick, Murphy, Baretti,
Dr. Burney and other visitors to the house. Over the
fireplace, and also by Reynolds, was the double picture
of Mrs. Thrale and Queenie, which was exhibited in
the Grosvenor Gallery in 1884. In the grounds,
besides plantations, and high-walled kitchen gardens
with ice-houses and pineries, there was an encircling
shrubbery which bordered a gravelled walk of nearly
two miles. There was also a spring pond, dug by
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>
Thrale, which, apparently in imitation of Duck Island
in St. James’s Park, boasted its Dick’s Island; and
there was “a cool summer-house,” where Johnson
wrote and studied, and Fanny read, or essayed to
read, <span class='it'>Irene</span>. It must have been a most delightful
country-house, meriting fully the Doctor’s grateful
eulogy that “none but itself could be its parallel.”
“I have found nothing,” he wrote from Lichfield in
1767, “that withdraws my affections from the friends
whom I left behind, or which makes me less desirous
of reposing at that place which your kindness and
Mr. Thrale’s allows me to call my <span class='it'>home</span>.” “These are
as good people,” he said to Miss Burney in the first
days of her visit, “as you can be with; you can go
to no better house; they are all good nature; nothing
makes them angry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He himself seems to have softened with his environment.
Although, as Fanny says, the freedom
with which he condemned what he disapproved was
astonishing, and his strength of language would to
most persons be intolerable, he presented, upon the
whole, a far more benignant aspect than that in which
he is usually exhibited by Boswell. He is Johnson in
clover, and <span class='it'>en belle humeur</span>; happier and more at ease
than he is elsewhere, and therefore more agreeable.
To the yet undisclosed author of <span class='it'>Evelina</span> he is especially
gracious, and even affectionate. He kisses her hand;
makes her sit by him; pays her elaborate compliments;
and no one, when he pleased, could do that
better. “Harry Fielding,” he protested, “never drew
so good a character” as her Mr. Smith. “Such a fine
varnish of low politeness!—such a struggle to appear
a gentleman! Madam [to Mrs. Thrale], there is no
<span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>
character better drawn anywhere—in any book, or by
any author”—an extravagance which almost leads one
particular author present to “poke herself under the
table.” He bursts out with sudden quotations from
<span class='it'>Evelina</span>:—with Miss Branghton’s, “Only think, Polly!
Miss has danced with a Lord!”—he rallies poor
Mr. Seward on his resemblance to the Holborn beau.—“Why
you only want a tambour waistcoat, to
look like Mr. Smith!” Then he is heard grumbling
to himself over a letter from Fanny’s medical adviser,
Dr. Jebb, whose penmanship is that of a tradesman.
“Mr. Branghton would have written his name with
just such beastly flourishes!” But perhaps the acme
of his amiable speeches is his frank comparison of
“dear little Burney,” as he comes to call her, with
Fielding and Richardson. “Richardson,” he said,
“would have been really afraid of her; there is
merit,” he went on, “in <span class='it'>Evelina</span> which he could not
have borne. No; it would not have done! unless,
indeed, she would have flattered him prodigiously.
Harry Fielding, too, would have been afraid of her;
there is nothing so delicately finished in all Harry
Fielding’s works as in <span class='it'>Evelina</span>.” Then, shaking his
head at her, he exclaimed, “O, you little character-monger
you!”—an appellation which must be admitted
to be singularly appropriate. On another
occasion, he declared that she was his “hero.” “Dr.
Goldsmith was my last; but I have had none since his
time, till my little Burney came.”<a id='r39'/><a href='#f39' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[39]</span></sup></a> “I admire her”—he
<span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>
said again, and to her face—“for her observation,
for her good sense, for her humour, for her discernment,
for her manner of expressing them, and for all
her writing talents.” Decidedly it was good to be
praised by Johnson; and one may well forgive Miss
Burney for doubting whether she could possibly live
up to his laudation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Visitors to Streatham Place came and went so freely
that it is difficult to chronicle them. Among the rest
was that accomplished <span class='it'>esprit fort</span>, Mrs. Elizabeth
Montagu, to whom Mrs. Thrale could not deny herself
the pleasure of exhibiting her own special prize
and discovery, the author of <span class='it'>Evelina</span>. Mrs. Montagu
came to Streatham by invitation, accompanied by her
friend, Miss Gregory. Dr. Johnson was very anxious
that “Burney” should attack the “Queen of the Blue
Stockings,” much as, in his own hot youth, he had
hawked at all established wits. But Mrs. Thrale,
finding that Mrs. Montagu knew nothing of <span class='it'>Evelina</span>,
disclosed the secret of the authorship so abruptly,
that Fanny fairly took to her heels and fled. Hence
she saw less of the great lady than she would otherwise;
and between the extreme blame of “Daddy”
Crisp and the extreme praise of Mrs. Thrale, was
not perhaps greatly prepossessed in favour of Mrs.
Montagu, who, moreover, had been so ill-advised as
never to have heard of <span class='it'>Evelina</span>. But Mrs. Montagu
was very well-bred and polite; and easily fell in with
Dr. Johnson’s suggestion that Miss Burney should
<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>
accompany the rest of those present to the housewarming
with which she hoped shortly to open her
new abode in Portman Square,—that famous mansion
of the feather-hangings celebrated by Cowper’s—</p>

<p class='line0'>“The Birds put off their every hue</p>
<p class='line0'>To dress a room for Montagu.”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>It was in reference to a suggestion by Mrs. Montagu
that Fanny’s dedication was good enough to have
been written by her father—a suggestion which, with
all her filial affection, Fanny could scarcely be expected
to welcome very warmly—that Johnson uttered one
of his common-sense deliverances on criticism. “You
must not mind that”—he said of Mrs. Montagu’s
impolitic remark,—“for such things are always
said where books are successful. There are three
distinct kinds of judges upon all new authors or
productions; the first are those who know no rules,
but pronounce entirely from their natural taste and
feelings; the second are those who know and judge
by rules; and the third are those who know, but are
above the rules. These last are those you should
wish to satisfy. Next to them rate the natural
judges; but ever despise those opinions that are
formed by the rules.” Of this second class, his own
“Dick Minim” is an admirable exemplification.<a id='r40'/><a href='#f40' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[40]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>In January, 1779, Miss Burney was again at St.
Martin’s Street, her sister Susan being from home.
St. Martin’s Street has a mysterious visit from “a
square old gentleman, well-wigged, formal, grave and
important,” who suddenly asks her if she is not
<span class='it'>Evelina</span>, and turns out to be Dr. Francklin, chaplain
<span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span>
to the Royal Academy. Then she is invited to
Sir Joshua’s to meet Mrs. and Miss [Mary] Horneck
(Goldsmith’s “Jessamy Bride”), soon to be married
to Colonel Gwyn. The ladies had said that they
would walk a hundred and sixty miles to see her, so
there was nothing to excuse her for not stepping
across the Fields to No. 47. Here she met another
admirer, Peg Woffington’s witty and eccentric sister,
Mrs. Cholmondeley; and Lord Palmerston, father of
the Victorian premier; and Burke’s brother William,
the “honest William” of Goldsmith’s <span class='it'>Retaliation</span>. All,
and especially Sir Joshua, were most cordial, though
Mrs. Cholmondeley’s “pointed speeches,” Duval <span class='it'>Ma
foi’s</span>, and references to <span class='it'>Evelina</span> generally, would have
been embarrassing, even to a less nervous person
than the author. Mrs. Cholmondeley, among other
things, had been to Lowndes for information, getting
nothing from that windbag but intelligence that a
gentleman had betted that the writer of <span class='it'>Evelina</span> was
a man, while she, Mrs. Cholmondeley, felt equally
convinced it was a woman. “But now”—she added—“we
are both out; for it’s a girl!”—which must be
accepted as unanswerable testimony to Fanny’s youthful
appearance at six-and-twenty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This interview with Mrs. Cholmondeley, who had
been one of the book’s earliest and most energetic
trumpeters (it was she, indeed, who had first recommended
it “among the wits”), was of course, followed
by an invitation, which proved a most important one.
For at Mrs. Cholmondeley’s in Hertford Street she
met, not only the beautiful “St. Cecilia” of Reynolds,
with her almost equally beautiful sister, Miss Linley;
but she met “St. Cecilia’s” husband, the all-conquering
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>
author of the recently-produced <span class='it'>School for Scandal</span> and
manager of Drury Lane, Richard Brinsley Sheridan
himself, of whom she writes admiringly. He has
“a good though I don’t think a handsome face. He
is tall, and very upright, and his appearance and
address are at once manly and fashionable, without
the smallest tincture of foppery or modish graces. In
short, I like him vastly, and think him every way
worthy his beautiful companion,”—to whom, Fanny
adds, he was manifestly much devoted. By and by,
Sheridan introduced himself to Miss Burney, and was
most agreeable. He had been telling her father, he
said, that he had long expected to see in her “a lady
of the gravest appearance, with the quickest parts.”
He expressed the highest admiration for <span class='it'>Evelina</span>,
adding that he hoped she (Miss Burney) did not
intend to throw away her pen. He was very curious
to know what she was about, and Sir Joshua observed
that she must succeed in “anything in the dialogue
way.” Mr. Sheridan assented. He thought “she
should write a comedy.” “And you,” said the
kind Sir Joshua presently, “would take anything of
hers, would you not?—unsight, unseen?” “Yes,” he
answered with quickness, “and make her a bow and
my best thanks into the bargain.” Here was a piece
of news to post off to Susan!</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a matter of fact, Miss Burney was already
engaged upon a dramatic essay. Both her father
and “Daddy” Crisp were anxious that, before interest
cooled, she should follow up her first success by some
other work; and from the date of Mrs. Thrale’s first
letter to Dr. Burney,<a id='r41'/><a href='#f41' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[41]</span></sup></a> that lady had been pressing her
<span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>
to write for the stage. She had the same conviction
as Reynolds that something “in the dialogue way”
would suit her young friend. <span class='it'>Evelina</span>—Mrs. Thrale
thought—ran so naturally into conversations that it
absolutely and plainly pointed that path to her. If
she could not do better than Hannah More, who got
nearly four hundred pounds for her foolish play,<a id='r42'/><a href='#f42' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[42]</span></sup></a> she
deserved to be whipped—said this kindly enthusiast.
Dr. Johnson, after see-sawing immoderately, proposed,
in a fit of untimely levity, that her first work
should be entitled, <span class='it'>Streatham: A Farce</span>; but he, too,
heartily approved. Mrs. Montagu, who was consulted,
though she was sympathetic, was not so sure.
She advanced the case of Fielding, who failed upon
the stage. And “Daddy” Crisp was still more half-hearted.
He wrote to Fanny an admirable letter
upon the subject. While he was urgent that she
should do something, he was by no means satisfied
that the something in question should be a comedy.
In a second letter he developed his ideas. She had
gained much: she had much to lose. And play-writing—for
her—had its peculiar difficulties. Her
delicacy (and she was a prude, she knew herself)
would debar her from those frequent lively freedoms
without which comedy would lose wonderfully of its
salt and spirit. All the same he would evidently
not have her try the bloodless and prevalent sentimental
comedy. About Fielding, he agreed with
Mrs. Montagu. Finally, though he did not wholly
desire to discourage her from the attempt, he thought
that, in entering upon it, she must surrender a part
<span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>
of her strength. And here we may use his actual
words:—“In these little entertaining elegant histories
[such as <span class='it'>Evelina</span>], the writer has his full scope; as
large a range as he pleases to hunt in—to pick, cull,
select whatever he likes: he takes his own time—he
may be as minute as he pleases, and the more minute
the better, provided that taste, a deep and penetrating
knowledge of human nature and the world, accompany
that minuteness. When this is the case, the very soul,
and all its most secret recesses and workings, are
developed and laid as open to the view, as the blood-globules
circulating in a frog’s foot, when seen through
a microscope. The exquisite touches such a work is
capable of (of which <span class='it'>Evelina</span> is, without flattery, a
glaring instance), are truly charming. But of these
great advantages, these resources, you are strangely
curtailed the moment you begin a comedy. There,
everything passes in dialogue,—all goes on rapidly—narrative
and descriptive, if not extremely short,
becomes intolerable. The detail which in Fielding,
Marivaux, and Crébillon, is so delightful, on the stage
would bear down all patience. There all must be
compressed into quintessence; the moment the scene
ceases to move on briskly, and business seems to
hang, sighs and groans are the consequence. Dreadful
sound!—In a word, if the plot, the story of the
comedy does not open and unfold itself in the easy,
natural, unconstrained flow of the dialogue—if that
dialogue does not go on with spirit, wit, variety, fun,
humour, repartee,—and all in short into the bargain—<span class='it'>serviteur!</span>—good-bye
t’ ye!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is excellently said, and shows once again how
precept may excel practice,—though, to be sure,
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>
“Daddy” Crisp’s <span class='it'>Virginia</span> was a tragedy, and not a
comedy. In a later letter Fanny’s Mentor modified
his views to the extent of admitting that it was possible,
with due contrivance and dexterity, to display
light principles without light expressions; but he stuck
to the proposition that he would never allow his
Fannikin “to sacrifice a grain of female delicacy for
all the wit of Congreve and Vanbrugh put together,”—and
in this she was entirely of his mind. These
letters preceded the interview with Sheridan; and as
we have already said, she had probably begun to work
on a comedy still earlier.<a id='r43'/><a href='#f43' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[43]</span></sup></a> When, in February, she
got back to Streatham, she made the acquaintance
of Arthur Murphy, in whose <span class='it'>Way to Keep Him</span> she
had acted at Barborne Lodge. He, too, volunteered
the suggestion that she should write for the stage.
Comedy, in his opinion, was the forte of <span class='it'>Evelina</span>, and he
offered his skilled assistance. He subsequently gave
her some rules by which she was too far advanced in
her work to profit—rules which, Johnson consolingly
told her, she would do just as well without. In May
her play is finished, though “on account of the various
Maecenases who would expect to be consulted,” the
greatest secrecy is observed. Murphy applauds; and
so does Mrs. Thrale. Johnson apparently was not
consulted. But when it is carried off by Dr. Burney
to “Daddy” Crisp, the verdict of Fanny’s “highest
court” is unfavourable. Indeed, in what she calls a
“hissing, groaning, cat-calling epistle,” they go as far
as to recommend its suppression. Not only did it
recall the <span class='it'>Femmes Savantes</span> of Molière (which Fanny
had never read), but they regarded the plot and
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>
incidents as insufficient to hold the attention of the
audience. Fanny took her disappointment bravely,
and at once threw her work aside. Later on, when it
became necessary to explain matters to Sheridan, there
was some talk of remodelling, and with this object the
fourth act was almost entirely re-written. But Crisp,
who was appealed to, stood to his guns. He thought
the capital defect of an ill-planned fable beyond
remedy, though he admitted the wit of the play.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here the matter seems to have rested; and all we
know of the suppressed piece is, that it was entitled
<span class='it'>The Witlings</span>, and that the <span class='it'>dramatis personae</span> included,
among others, a quotation-loving Lady Smatter (in
whom Mrs. Thrale professed to recognise her own
portrait), Mrs. Voluble, Mrs. Wheedle, Mrs. Sapient,
Dabbler, Censor, and a “great oaf, Bobby.” There
was also—and the point is memorable in view of the
title of Miss Burney’s next novel—a Cecilia, the loss
and restoration of whose fortune were matters in
debate. Whether Dr. Burney and his friend were
right in their judgment of <span class='it'>The Witlings</span>, cannot now be
affirmed or denied in the absence of the MS. Probably
they were right; though they do not seem to have
borne in mind how material a part the acting bears in
the success of a piece; and at Sheridan’s theatre, Miss
Burney’s comedy would certainly have been splendidly
represented. King, Dodd, Palmer, Parsons, Mrs.
Abington, and Miss Pope—would all probably have
taken part in it. But Fanny’s advisers, it is clear,
were also actuated by another reflection, of which
Murphy knew nothing: they feared the effect upon
the author of a possible <span class='it'>fiasco</span>. “My great scruple all
along has been the consideration of the great stake
<span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>
you are playing for,”—writes Mr. Crisp,—“how much
you have to lose, and how unequal your delicate and
tender frame of mind would be to sustain the shock of
a failure of success, should that be the case.” This is
perhaps not a critical reason; but, at the same time,
it is a reason beyond criticism. And “Daddy” Crisp
shows plainly that it was <span class='it'>The Witlings</span> he doubted,—not
Fanny’s ability to produce comedy. For, in an
earlier letter, he had suggested to her a fresh effort,
based upon certain of her own experiences as narrated
to her father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was early in 1779 that Miss Burney made the
acquaintance of Sheridan at Mrs. Cholmondeley’s; and
it was not until the beginning of 1780 that <span class='it'>The
Witlings</span> was practically abandoned. In the interim,
at Streatham and elsewhere, Fanny seems to have
spent her time very agreeably. In May, she went
with the Thrales to Brighton, returning, apparently,
early in June, owing to the sudden illness of Mr.
Thrale. But in October they were again at Brighton,
taking Knole Park (Lord Dorset’s) and its magnificent
galleries in their way, and making a short stay at
Tunbridge Wells, where Miss Burney pours scorn upon
the famous Pantiles as a fashionable pleasure walk.
“It has no beauty in itself, and borrows none from
foreign aid, as it has only common houses at one side,
and little millinery and Tunbridge-ware shops at the
other, and at each end is choked up by buildings that
intercept all prospect.” At Brighton, no doubt in the
interests of <span class='it'>Evelina</span>, Mrs. Thrale at once inscribed their
names at the booksellers’ shops upon the Steyne. At
this date there were no great notabilities at Brighthelmstone,
as Fanny styles the place, save “that celebrated
<span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>
wit and libertine,” the Hon. Mr. Beauclerk, and
his wife, Lady Di; Cumberland the dramatist and
his family; and Mrs. Musters, whose son married
Byron’s first love, Mary Chaworth. The Miss Cumberlands
were reckoned “the flashers of the place,”
and Fanny gives an account of their father which reads
like a scene from the <span class='it'>Critic</span>. “Sir Fretful Plagiary”
was already prejudiced against her on account of
her success; and when he called on Mrs. Thrale, he
showed it. As soon as she had quitted the room he
said to Mrs. Thrale, with a spiteful tone of voice,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Oh, that young lady is an author, I hear!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Yes,’ answered Mrs. Thrale, ‘author of <span class='it'>Evelina</span>.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Humph—I am told it has some humour!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Ay, indeed! Johnson says nothing like it has
appeared for years!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘So,’ cried he, biting his lips, and waving uneasily
in his chair, ’so, so!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Yes,’ continued she; ‘and Sir Joshua Reynolds told
Mr. Thrale he would give fifty pounds to know the
author!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘So, so—oh, vastly well!’ cried he, putting his
hand on his forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Nay!’ added she, ‘Burke himself sat up all night
to finish it!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This seemed quite too much for him; he put both
his hands to his face, and waving backwards and forwards,
said, ‘Oh, vastly well!—this will do for anything!’
with a tone as much as to say, Pray, no more!
Then Mrs. Thrale bid him good night, longing, she
said, to call Miss Thrale first, and say, ‘So you won’t
speak to my daughter?—why, she is no author.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some of the persons sketched in Miss Burney’s
<span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>
journal are less known to fame than those who have
been mentioned, but they are not less cleverly drawn.
There is Mr. Seward, one of the Streatham <span class='it'>habitués</span>,
and the later author of <span class='it'>Biographiana</span>. Mr. Seward is
a brewer’s son, who dabbles in letters, and seems like
an earlier real-life version of Sir Charles Coldstream in
<span class='it'>Used Up</span>. With “Mr. Dry,” as Miss Burney calls him,
she playfully proposes to collaborate in a comedy, to
be entitled <span class='it'>Everything a Bore</span>. There is a real tragic
author, Dr. John Delap, who, while as absent-minded
and as ignorant of the world as Parson Adams, is
engaged upon a play called <span class='it'>Macaria</span>,<a id='r44'/><a href='#f44' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[44]</span></sup></a> on the story of
the wife and daughter of Hercules, which Fanny has
to read and criticise—or rather eulogise. There is a
very musical, precocious, and semi-French ten-year-old
schoolgirl, Miss Birch, who sings sentimental airs from
French operas, and says to her friends, “<span class='it'>Que je vous
adore!”—“Ah, permettez que je me mette à vos pieds!</span>”
etc., with a dying languor that is equally delightful
and preposterous. And there is that finished and
fascinating coquette of coquettes, Miss Sophy Streatfield
of Tunbridge Wells, who knows Greek as well as
Miss Elizabeth Carter or Mrs. Buller, is as lovely as
Mrs. Crewe or Mrs. Sheridan, and has moreover a
faculty for shedding tears so becoming to her lackadaisical
cast of beauty that she is periodically required
(like the water works at Vauxhall) to display
her unique gift for the public delectation. Fanny’s
description of Miss Streatfield’s mechanical <span class='it'>grandes eaux</span>
is too good to be neglected. We must imagine her
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>
surrounded by attentive spectators, with Mrs. Thrale
(like Mrs. Jarley) for exhibitor. “ ‘Yes, do cry a
little, Sophy [<span class='it'>in a wheedling voice</span>], pray, do! Consider,
now, you are going to-day, and it’s very hard if you
won’t cry a little; indeed, S. S., you ought to cry.’
Now for the wonder of wonders. When Mrs. Thrale,
in a coaxing voice, suited to a nurse soothing a baby,
had run on for some time—while all the rest of us, in
laughter, joined in the request—two crystal tears came
into the soft eyes of the S. S., and rolled gently down
her cheeks! Such a sight I never saw before, nor could
I have believed.<a id='r45'/><a href='#f45' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[45]</span></sup></a> She offered not to conceal or dissipate
them: on the contrary, she really contrived to
have them seen by everybody. She looked, indeed,
uncommonly handsome, for her pretty face was not
like Chloe’s [in Prior], blubbered; it was smooth and
elegant, and neither her features nor complexion were
at all ruffled; nay, indeed, she was smiling all the
time.” It is melancholy to think that a lady who
possessed in such perfection the attributes of Venus
Victrix, should die unmarried. Yet this was the
untoward fate of the “S. S.” “Everybody’s admiration,
and nobody’s choice,” as one of her friends said,
she survived until 1835, an ancient maiden lady, concerning
whom we do not even know whether—like
Pope’s Patty Blount—she retained to the last the
charm of her wonderful blue eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Miss Streatfield is not the person upon whom
Miss Burney concentrates her fullest powers of
description. That honour is reserved for an unidentified
<span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>
Mr. B——y, to whom she devotes several pages.
Mr. B——y, or “The General,” as she styles him, is an
Irishman. He has been a Commissary in Germany;
is between sixty and seventy, but means to pass for
thirty; a professed admirer of the sex, whom he
invariably calls “fair females”; garnishes his speech
with French tags of the most hackneyed kind; quotes
often and inaccurately; and although Fanny, afraid
of painting too much <span class='it'>en noir</span>, declares him to be
worthy and moral at bottom, seems to outward view
to be nothing but a blundering, prejudiced, puffing,
domineering busybody and bore. He is enraged with
Reynolds for charging seventy guineas “to scratch out
a head”; he is enraged with Garrick for living like
a person of quality; he is enraged with Agujari for
getting fifty pounds for a mere song; he is equally
enraged with Rauzzini because the “fair females” sigh
over him, and make a man sick. But the General’s
standing topic is his health; his rooted antipathy,
physicians; and his favourite story—which he tells
three or four times a day—in this wise:—“ ‘Some
years ago,’—he says—‘let’s see, how many? in the
year ’71—ay, ’71, ’72—thereabouts—I was taken very
ill, and, by ill luck, I was persuaded to ask the advice
of one of these Dr. Gallipots:—oh, how I hate them
all! Sir, they are the vilest pickpockets,—know
nothing, sir! Nothing in the world! poor ignorant
mortals! and they pretend—in short, sir, I hate them
all; I have suffered so much by them, sir—lost four
years of the happiness of my life—let’s see, ’71, ’72,
’73, ’74—ay, four years, sir!—mistook my case, sir!—and
all that kind of thing. Why, sir, my feet swelled
as big as two horses’ heads! I vow I will never
<span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>
consult one of these Dr. Gallipot fellows again! lost
me, sir, four years of the happiness of my life!—why,
I grew quite an object!—you would hardly have
known me!—lost all the calves of my legs!—had not
an ounce of flesh left!—and as to the rouge—why, my
face was the colour of that candle!—those Gallipot
fellows!—why they robbed me of four years—let me
see, ’71, ’72—’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then it all goes over again!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This story is always <span class='it'>a-propos</span>; if health is mentioned,
it is instanced to show its precariousness; if
life, to bewail what he has lost of it; if pain, to relate
what he has suffered; if pleasure, to recapitulate what
he has been deprived of; but if a physician is hinted at,
eagerly indeed is the opportunity seized of inveighing
against the whole faculty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is more, especially of the General grumbling
over the newspaper; but enough has been given. In
all these pictures, it may be noted, Miss Burney insists
upon her fidelity to fact. “I never mix truth and
fiction,” she tells “Daddy” Crisp. “I have other
purposes for imaginary characters than filling letters
with them.” “The world, and especially the Great
world, is so filled with absurdity of various sorts, now
bursting forth in impertinence, now in pomposity, now
giggling in silliness, and now yawning in dullness, that
there is no occasion for invention to draw what is
striking in every possible species of the ridiculous.”
As time went on, her opportunities for study rather
increased than decreased. At the beginning of 1780,
as already related, the question of her comedy was
again partly revived. Then there were proposals for a
tour in Italy with the Thrales which was afterwards
<span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>
abandoned. But in April she went with her friends
to Bath, making acquaintance <span class='it'>en route</span>, at the Bear at
Devizes, with the hostess’s clever son, who afterwards
became Sir Thomas Lawrence. At Bath they
lodge (like Smollett’s Mr. Bramble) in the South
Parade, with Allen’s Prior Park, the meadows, and
“the soft flowing Avon” in view; and are speedily
absorbed in the fashionable diversions of the place.
Prelates were preaching at the Abbey and St. James’s
Churches; there were public breakfasts in the Spring
Gardens; the Pump Room was crowded with company
and the Walks with promenaders; Mrs. Siddons was
playing Belvidera at Mr. Palmer’s Theatre in Orchard
Street; and life was one endless round of fiddles,
dinners, concerts, assemblies, balls, card-parties and
scandal. Miss Burney’s canvas becomes more and
more crowded, and less detailed, affording space only
for occasional vignettes such as the following: “In
the evening we had Mrs. L——, a fat, round, panting,
short-breathed old widow; and her daughter,
a fubsy, good-humoured, laughing, silly, merry old
maid. They are rich folks, and live together very
comfortably, and the daughter sings—not in your fine
Italian taste! no, that she and her mother agree to
hold very cheap—but all about Daphne, and Chloe,
and Damon, and Phillis, and Jockey!” Or this,—on
the same page,—“Mrs. K—— is a Welsh lady, of immense
fortune, who has a house in the Crescent, and
lives in a most magnificent style. She is about fifty,
very good-humoured, well-bred, and civil, and her
waist does not measure above a hogshead. She is not
very deep, I must own; but what of that? If all were
wits, where would be the admirers at them?”
<span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Johnson did not take part in the Bath expedition.
He would, indeed, have come; but Mrs. Thrale had
discouraged his doing so, feeling sure that a watering-place
life would have horribly wearied him, which is
not only possible but extremely probable. Literature—that
is to say the literature of 1780—was nevertheless
fairly represented in Bladud’s ancient City.
First and foremost there was Mrs. Thrale’s rival,
Mrs. Montagu, with her attendant train of blue-stockings;
there was Anstey of the <span class='it'>New Bath Guide</span>,
whom—as we have seen—wiseacres had credited with
<span class='it'>Evelina</span>; there was Mrs. Susannah Dobson, the translator
of <span class='it'>Petrarch</span>; there was Melmoth of Pliny’s <span class='it'>Letters</span>;
there was Miss Elizabeth Carter of Epictetus; there
was Lady Miller of Batheaston and the famous Frascati
vase wherein—according to Macaulay—“fools were
wont to put bad verses,” but which, however, at this
precise moment of time, was not <span class='it'>en fonction</span>.<a id='r46'/><a href='#f46' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[46]</span></sup></a> To the
failings of her <span class='it'>confrères</span> and <span class='it'>consœurs</span>, Miss Burney, it
must be confessed, in her capacity of “faithful
historian” is not always “very kind.” Of poor Lady
Miller, who died a year later, she writes, “She is a
round, plump, coarse-looking dame of about forty, and
while all her aim is to appear an elegant woman of
fashion, all her success is to seem an ordinary woman
in very common life, with fine clothes on. Her habits
are bustling, her air is mock-important, and her
<span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span>
manners very inelegant.” Of Mrs. Dobson, she
reports that “though coarse, low-bred, forward, self-sufficient,
and flaunting, she seems to have a strong
and masculine understanding, and parts that, had they
been united with modesty, or fostered by education,
might have made her a shining and agreeable woman;
but she has evidently kept low company, which she
has risen above in literature, but not in manners.” Of
Miss Carter, on the contrary, then growing old, Miss
Burney says, that she “never saw age so graceful in
the female sex yet, her whole face seems to beam with
goodness, piety and philanthropy.” Anstey she finds
not very agreeable—“shyly important, and silently
proud,” and moreover unable to forget that he is the
author of a popular work; while <span class='it'>Pliny</span> Melmoth is
written down as “intolerably self-sufficient.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some of the Bath visitors were naval officers who—it
should be observed—did not at all accept Captain
Mirvan’s portrait as typical of their profession. One
of them, Mrs. Thrale’s cousin, Captain Cotton, pretended
“in a comical and good-humoured way” to
resent it highly; and so—he told the author—did all
the Captains in the Navy. Admiral Byron, too,—the
Byron of the “narrative” in <span class='it'>Don Juan</span>,—though he
admired <span class='it'>Evelina</span>, was “not half pleased with the
Captain’s being such a brute.” But Miss Burney herself
is unconvinced and impenitent. “The more I see
of sea-captains, the less reason I have to be ashamed of
Captain Mirvan; for they have all so irresistible a
propensity to wanton mischief,—to roasting beaux,
and detesting old women, that I quite rejoice I showed
the book to no one ere printed, lest I should have been
prevailed upon to soften his character.” What the
<span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span>
sea-captains, and the Bathonians generally thought of
their critic, is not related, save in a sentence from
<span class='it'>Thraliana</span>:—“Miss Burney was much admired at Bath
(1780); the puppy-men said, ‘She had such a drooping
air and such a timid intelligence’; or ‘a timid air,’ I
think it was, and ‘a drooping intelligence’; never
sure was such a collection of pedantry and affectation
as filled Bath when we were on that spot.” The
almost imperceptible feline touch in this passage serves
to remind us that, in the padlocked privacy of her
personal records, Mrs. Thrale did not scruple (like Dr.
Johnson) to mingle praise with blame when occasion
required. From other entries in <span class='it'>Thraliana</span>, Fanny
seems to have sometimes vexed her friend by her
prudish punctiliousness and dread of patronage, as
well as by her perhaps more defensible preference for
her own family. “What a blockhead Dr. Burney is to
be always sending for his daughter home so! what a
monkey! is she not better and happier with me than
she can be anywhere else?” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. “If I did not provide
Fanny with every wearable—every wishable, indeed—it
would not vex me to be served so; but to see the
impossibility of compensating for the pleasures of St.
Martin’s Street, makes one at once merry and mortified.”
There were other reasons, as we shall learn
presently, why Dr. Burney was anxious that Fanny
should come back.<a id='r47'/><a href='#f47' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[47]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, early in June, the Bath visit came to
a premature conclusion. Returning from a visit to
Lady Miller, Mrs. Thrale received intelligence of the
<span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>
Gordon riots. Her house in the Borough had been
besieged by the mob, and only saved from destruction
by the assistance of the Guards and the presence of
mind of the superintendent, Mr. Perkins. Streatham
Place was also threatened, and emptied of its furniture.
What was worse, Mr. Thrale, then in a very unsatisfactory
state of health, had been falsely denounced as
a papist; and as there were also rioters at Bath, Mrs.
Thrale and Fanny decided that it would be best to
quit that place, and travel about the country. They
started for Brighton; but before they got to Salisbury,
London was again, in Dr. Burney’s words, “the most
secure residence in the kingdom.” For the remainder
of the year 1780, Fanny seems to have stayed quietly
at St. Martin’s Street and Chessington. In March,
1781, she came to town to find the Thrales settled for
the time in a hired house in Grosvenor Square and
talking vaguely of continental travel—to Spa, to Italy,
and elsewhere. But Mr. Thrale was obviously growing
worse; and in April he died suddenly of apoplexy,
“on the morning of a day on which half the fashion of
London had been invited to an intended assembly at his
house.” His death threw an infinity of additional care
upon his already over-burdened widow; but, as soon
as she was able, she again summoned Miss Burney to
Streatham Place, where off and on, she lived until
September. Then “Daddy” Crisp, descending from
his Surrey retreat, bore her away perforce to Chessington;
and at Chessington she continued to stay until
the beginning of 1782, when she returned to Newton
House in order to be present at her sister Susan’s
marriage at St. Martin’s Church to Captain Molesworth
Phillips of the Marines, a comrade, in Cook’s
<span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>
last voyage, of James Burney. After this, Fanny
remained for some time quietly at home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reason why Dr. Burney wished to get his
daughter away from Streatham Place, and why, at
last, Mr. Crisp fetched her thence,—may perhaps be
guessed. She had begun to work upon another novel;
and her long absences from home seriously interfered
with its progress. During the latter half of 1780,
she had written steadily; but, in the following year,
her renewed intercourse with Mrs. Thrale once more
interrupted her labours; and her two fathers grew
anxious that she should lose no further time. Of the
advantages up to a certain point of her connection
with the Streatham circle, both of them had been fully
aware—Crisp especially. “Your time,” he had written
to her in April, 1780, “could not be better employed,
for all your St. Martin’s daddy wanted to retain you
for some other purpose. You are now at school, the
great school of the world, where swarms of new ideas
and new characters will continually present themselves
before you,—</p>

</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>But there must be a limit, even to schooling; and that
limit, in the opinion of Dr. Burney and his friend,
had now been reached. So Fanny saw no more of
Streatham or Mrs. Thrale till her new book was
finished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edward Francis Burney, 1760-1848, the artist referred to
in the above paragraph, was a frequent contributor to the
Royal Academy between 1780 and 1793. His solitary “portrait
of a Lady,” 1785, <span class='it'>may</span> have been his cousin’s picture. His

the heroine and her father, were all introduced. The Evelina
of these designs is said to have strongly resembled the beautiful
Sophy Streatfield; and an artful compliment was paid to
Johnson by hanging his portrait in Mr. Villars’ parlour.

<p class='pindent'>The bibliography of Miss Burney’s first book is extremely
perplexing. In the “Advertisement” to <span class='it'>Cecilia</span>, the author
says that <span class='it'>Evelina</span> (which, it will be remembered, appeared in
January, 1778) passed “through Four Editions in one year.”
In the <span class='it'>Memoirs of Dr. Burney</span>, she implies that it went
through three editions in five months (ii. p. 135). But the
second and third editions are both dated 1779; and it must
have been in the first months of that year that the sale was
most active. In May, 1779, comes a reference to the fourth
edition as on the stocks. “<span class='it'>Evelina</span> continues to sell in a most
wonderful manner; a fourth edition is preparing, with cuts
[it should be copper plates], designed by Mortimer just before
he died, and executed by Hall and Bartolozzi” (<span class='it'>Diary and
Letters</span>, 1892, i. p. 139). John Hamilton Mortimer, A.R.A.,
the artist indicated, died 4th February, 1779. His drawings,
which cost £73, still exist. It may here be added that Mrs.
Chappel, of East Orchard, Shaftesbury, possesses a copy of the
second edition of <span class='it'>Evelina</span> (1779), presented to Dr. Burney,—whose

<div><h1>CHAPTER V<br/> <span class='sub-head'><span class='it'>CECILIA</span>—AND AFTER</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'>Either from Mr. Crisp’s injunctions as to secrecy, or
from suppressions in the <span class='it'>Diary</span> as we now have it, Miss
Burney’s record contains but few references to the
progress of <span class='it'>Cecilia</span>—which was the name of the new
book. And these references occur chiefly in her letters
to her critic at Chessington. As already stated, there
had been a shadowy “Cecilia,” with an imperilled
fortune, in the comedy of <span class='it'>The Witlings</span>. In December,
1779, Miss Burney had shown her “Daddy” a sketch
of a fresh heroine (then apparently called “Albina”);
and he speaks of this fresh heroine’s story in the
following April as a “new and striking” idea, affording,
among other advantages, “a large field for
unhackneyed characters, observations, [and] subjects
for satire and ridicule.” It further appears that the
Cecilia or Albina in question was to be “unbeautiful”
but “clever,”—a deviation from the conventional in
which (whether she carried it out or not) Miss Burney
must have anticipated some of her distinguished successors.
Ten months later, in February, 1781, she is
hard at work. “I think I shall always hate this book
which has kept me so long away from you, as much
as I shall always love <span class='it'>Evelina</span>, who first <span class='it'>comfortably</span>
<span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>
introduced me to you,”—she tells Mrs. Thrale. Then,—a
year later still,—after the long interruption in
her task following upon Mr. Thrale’s death, there
are groanings over the labour of transcription,—a
volume (and there are five) takes a fortnight,—impatience
on her father’s part for publication,—the usual
nervous apprehensions of hopeless failure, and much
defence and discussion of detail with “Daddy” Crisp.
At last,—when Mrs. Thrale has declared that <span class='it'>Evelina</span>
was but a baby to the new venture; and the cautious
critic of Chessington, protesting that there had been
nothing like it since Fielding and Smollett, has rashly
proclaimed his willingness to ensure its rapid and
universal success for half-a-crown,—on Friday the 12th
July, 1782, <span class='it'>Cecilia; or, Memoirs of an Heiress: By the
Author of Evelina</span>, price 12s. 6d., sewed, is published by
Messrs. Payne and Cadell, in five <span class='it'>duodecimo</span> volumes.
The first edition was of two thousand copies; and the
price paid to the author for the copyright, £250.<a id='r49'/><a href='#f49' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[49]</span></sup></a> As
the Payne above mentioned was none other than the
friend of the family, “Honest Tom Payne” of the
Mews’ Gate, afterwards James Burney’s father-in-law,
it may fairly be assumed that this amount, trifling as
it must seem,—contrasted with the sums received
modern authors addressing larger audiences under
different conditions,—was not considered inadequate
by Fanny’s advisers. Indeed, from a chance reference
<span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span>
in the <span class='it'>Memoirs</span> to the arrangement of “the Cecilian
business,” we may conclude that, upon this occasion,
Dr. Burney himself took charge of the negotiations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neither for ingenuity nor novelty had the plot of
Miss Burney’s first story been remarkable. The plot
of her second attempt, though still conventional, was
somewhat more ambitious. Miss Cecilia Beverley, a
young lady in her twenty-first year, is heir, not only
to ten thousand pounds from her father, but to three
thousand <span class='it'>per annum</span> from her uncle, the Dean of ——,
to which latter inheritance is attached the restrictive
condition that, should she marry, the happy man must
take her name as well as her money. This turns out
to be a very material detail in the novel. When the
story begins, the Dean of —— is just dead; and Miss
Beverley and her fortune, during the brief remainder
of her minority, are left in the hands of three guardians—a
fashionable and extravagant Mr. Harrel, a vulgar
and miserly Mr. Briggs, and a very proud and
pompous Mr. Delvile (of Delvile Castle). In the first
chapter of the story, Cecilia is quitting Mrs. Charlton,
with whom she has been staying, to take up her
quarters in town with the Harrels,—Mrs. Harrel, in
her green and salad days, having been the heroine’s
“most favourite young friend.” In London, where
would-be suitors—most of them attracted to the <span class='it'>beaux
yeux de sa cassette</span>—cluster about her like flies round a
honey pot, she speedily becomes aware that the playmate
of her youth is terribly “translated” by the
dissipations of a London life, that her friend’s husband
is an irredeemable gamester, and that both are palpably
on the down-grade. Her available means become
speedily involved in Harrel’s ever-urgent necessities;
<span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>
and the crisis of this part of the narrative is reached,
about the middle of volume three, by his suicide in
a very melodramatic fashion at Vauxhall Gardens,
where, for the nonce, the chief personages in the
book are ingeniously assembled. After Harrel’s death,
Cecilia goes to stay at Delvile Castle. Here an
attachment already begun with the son, Mortimer
Delvile, a young man at once excitable and irresolute,
is further developed. But now the dead hand comes
in. The haughty Delviles cannot bring themselves to
consent to the change of the family name, even “for
a consideration” of £3000 per annum. There are consequently
scenes, in one of which Mrs. Delvile, after
using extremely exaggerated expressions, exclaims
“my brain is on fire!”—and breaks a blood vessel.
Eventually, after she has been softened by illness, a
suggestion is made that Cecilia shall surrender her
uncle’s fortune, with its vexatious obligations, and
content herself with her Mortimer and her patrimony
of ten thousand pounds. Unfortunately for this proposition,
the ten thousand pounds in question are now
non-existent, having been absorbed by the creditors
of Harrel and others,—that is to say, by the Jews.
After this, a private marriage takes place, with the
connivance of Mrs. Delvile. But Cecilia’s troubles are
not yet at an end. Fresh and very unforeseen complications
arise, and, for a brief period, she goes as
mad as Clementina or Clarissa. At length the curtain
comes down upon a Johnsonian passage in which she
is left exhibiting the pensive and reluctant optimism
of <span class='it'>Rasselas</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If, in the foregoing rapid summary, it has not always
been possible to speak with uniform gravity, it is that,
<span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span>
to-day, the main issue of Cecilia’s story has become—as
the author’s own Captain Aresby would now have
said—a little <span class='it'>démodé</span>. In the present year of grace, it
is difficult to comprehend the social conditions which
should prevent a sensible man from marrying the
woman he loves (particularly if that woman have
£3,000 a year) simply because the concomitant surrender
of his family name would—as Mrs. Delvile
puts it—bring “the blood of his wronged ancestors
into his guilty cheeks.” But when <span class='it'>Cecilia</span> was written,
this was an other-guess matter; and the point was not
only seriously argued by bishops, peers and ladies of
quality, but was thought by no means undeserving of
anxious consideration. A noble Lord, who descended
from Elfrida, and had a castle in Warwickshire, was
distinctly of opinion that the obstructive attitude of
Mr. Delvile <span class='it'>père</span> was a correct one; while Mrs. Thrale,
who dated from Adam of Salzburg—one of the companions
of the Conqueror—was equally convinced that
her mother, Mrs. Salusbury, would have done just what
Mrs. Delvile did. But this debatable point apart,
Cecilia’s story is unquestionably clever. The characters—and
there are a crowd of them—are clearly drawn
and discriminated; the pictures of contemporary social
life are varied and very lively, while the famous
Vauxhall episode, if it be not precisely the tragic masterpiece
which it seemed to the fond eyes of admiring
“Daddy” Crisp, certainly contrives to hold the reader
in a genuine suspense of curiosity until the final event
is reached. The discussion between the mother and
son,—the other “crack scene” of the book—that,
indeed, for which the author declares she wrote the
whole, Mr. Crisp did not approve so much, and he
<span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>
was right. If it did not impress him, it impresses us
still less. Mrs. Delvile’s stormy heroics seem out of
all proportion to the gravity of the matter in hand,
and an unsympathetic reader, bewildered by the hail
of commination, may well be forgiven for wondering
whether the cause is worthy of the clamour. Nevertheless
Miss Burney, in clinging to her convictions
in regard to “name-compelling” ills, as well as in
declining to end her book “like the hack Italian operas,
with a jolly chorus that makes all parties good and all
parties happy,” was only acting in strict accordance
with the injunctions, received from more than one
adviser, to rely upon her own instincts, and not to
depart from them, when her mind was made up. And
it is a feature of her character, that, notwithstanding
her undoubted distrust of her powers, she was sometimes
as restive and intractable under criticism as
Richardson himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two scenes above indicated are those which are
most frequently referred to by Miss Burney’s critics.
But there are others which, if not as highly-wrought,
are as worthy of praise. The opera rehearsal,—at
which it was said the book always opened,—the
description of the <span class='it'>ton</span> parties, the long masquerade
chapter, and the dialogue between Albany, Briggs and
Hobson on Charity (which may be compared with that
on the same subject between Parson Adams and
Mr. Peter Pounce in <span class='it'>Joseph Andrews</span>), are well worth
reading. But the names remind us that Miss Burney
is, primarily, what Johnson called her, a “character-monger,”
and that her plot is subordinate to her
personages. Some of these, in spite of her protests, she
had evidently seen in the flesh; some she had half-seen
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>
or overheard; some she had wholly invented from
current social characteristics. Mr. Meadows, the absent-minded
and affectedly-indifferent, and Captain Aresby,
who interlards his conversation with French words
like the coming Silver Fork School and the lady in
Thackeray’s <span class='it'>Almack’s Adieu</span>—are probably examples
from the last category. Mr. Monckton and the
supercilious Sir Robert Floyer, the caustic Mr. Gosport
and the voluble Miss Larolles, she had doubtless met;
while in those days of gaming and E.O. tables, she had
probably heard of many Mr. Harrels. As to the miserly
and penurious Briggs (and the facility with which
one can label Miss Burney’s characters with defining
adjectives indicates one of her limitations), the consensus
of contemporary criticism seems to have decided that
he was overdrawn. But he is certainly not more
exaggerated than some of the later characters of
Dickens, and he is distinctly amusing, especially in
his encounters with “Don Pedigree,” as he calls his
colleague, Mr. Delvile. Hobson the builder, with his
large and puffy presence, his red waistcoat, and his
round curled wig, is a capital specimen of the bumptious
prosperous tradesman; while the thin, mean-looking,
cringing and obsequious Mr. Simkins (the hosier) is
another excellently observed and contrasted variety.
Morrice, the pushing and officious young lawyer, the
versatile Belfield, and that vivacious “agreeable Rattle”
of rank, Lady Honoria Pemberton, can only be named.
Lastly—for we must omit others altogether—comes
Johnson’s favourite Albany,—a cross between Apemantus
and Solomon Eagle,—whose stagy denunciations
certainly warrant the ingenuous inquiry of Mr. Hobson
whether “the gentleman might be speaking something
<span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>
by heart.” There should be an original for Albany;
but he has not been definitely revealed.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Cecilia</span> is more elaborate and much more mature
than <span class='it'>Evelina</span>. It is also more skilfully constructed,
and more carefully, though not so naturally, written.
But it is certainly too long; and towards the close
suggests something of the hurry imposed upon the
author by her eager father. It must also be confessed
that the last chapters are scarcely as interesting as
their forerunners. As to the success of the book
with its first audience, however, there can be no
doubt. Anxiously awaited, it was welcomed with the
warmest enthusiasm by numbers of readers; and by
no one more splendidly and royally than by Edmund
Burke, whose acquaintance Fanny had made at Sir
Joshua’s not very long before it appeared. When
it came out, Burke wrote her a long letter, which
was reprinted with subsequent editions. Few (he
told her), let their experience in life and manners
be what it might, would not find themselves better
informed concerning human nature, and their stock
of observation enriched, by reading <span class='it'>Cecilia</span>. “You
have,” he went on, “crowded into a few small volumes
an incredible variety of characters; most of them well
planned, well supported, and well contrasted with each
other. If there be any fault in this respect, it is one
in which you are in no great danger of being imitated.
Justly as your characters are drawn, perhaps they are
too numerous. But I beg pardon; I fear it is quite
in vain to preach economy to those who are come
young to excessive and sudden opulence.” Praising
her humour, her pathos, her “comprehensive and noble
moral,” and her sagacious observations, he concluded,—“In
<span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span>
an age distinguished by producing extraordinary
women, I hardly dare to tell you where my opinion
would place you amongst them. I respect your
modesty, that will not endure the commendations
which your merit forces from everybody.” A few
months later, she met Burke at the house of the Hon.
Miss Monckton (the “Lydia White” of that age),
when he was equally kind, though he ventured upon
some criticisms. He thought the masquerade scene
too long, and that something might be spared from
Harrel’s grand assembly; he did not like Morrice’s
part at the Pantheon;<a id='r50'/><a href='#f50' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[50]</span></sup></a> and he wished the conclusion
“either more happy or more miserable.” With this
last Fanny—as we have already seen—could not coincide;
but he promptly consoled her by another compliment.
Nothing had struck him so much as the
admirable skill with which her ingenious characters
made themselves known by their own words; and he
congratulated her upon her conquest of some of the
old wits, because of the difficulty of giving satisfaction
to those who piqued themselves on being past receiving
it. Also, he touched upon the amount she had obtained
from Payne and Cadell for the copyright, which he
evidently knew. “Why did you not send for your
own friend out of the city [<span class='it'>i.e.</span> Mr. Briggs]? He would
have taken care you should not part with it [<span class='it'>Cecilia</span>]
so much below par.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her older admirers were as kind. Sir Joshua was
perpetually bringing her intelligence of something
which had been said to her advantage; and Johnson
came no whit behind. Instructing Susy Thrale, who
had just put up her hair, and assumed womanly garb,
<span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>
he directed her, with mock solemnity, how to “increase
her consequence” by censuring <span class='it'>Cecilia</span>—much in
the manner in which the author of the <span class='it'>Female Quixote</span>
had recommended his own <span class='it'>Rambler</span>: “Tell the world
how ill it was conceived, and how ill executed. Tell
them how little there is in it of human nature, and
how well your knowledge of the world enables you
to judge of the failings in that book. Find fault
without fear; and if you are at a loss for any to find,
invent whatever comes into your mind, for you may
say what you please, with little fear of detection, since
of those who praise <span class='it'>Cecilia</span> not half have read it, and
of those who have read it, not half remember it. Go
to work, therefore, boldly; and particularly mark that
the character of Albany is extremely unnatural, to
your own knowledge, since you never met with such
a man at Mrs. Cummyn’s School.” A year later, his
enthusiasm was still unabated. “Sir”—he said to Boswell—“if
you talk of <span class='it'>Cecilia</span>, talk on.” From other
sources came commendations as pleasant. Mrs.
Chapone, who, as Miss Mulso, had cried over <span class='it'>Clarissa</span>,
could not, for very excess of eagerness, cry at all over
<span class='it'>Cecilia</span>. “I was in an agitation that half killed me,
that shook all my nerves,”—she told the author,—“and
made me unable to sleep at nights from the suspense
I was in.” Mrs. Walsingham, the witty daughter of
the wit Sir Charles Hanbury Williams, related how
Queen Charlotte herself had spoken of the book, and
criticised Mr. Briggs; while, from another source,
came tidings that Gibbon had read it in a day, which
was a third of the time that even Burke had taken.
But Miss Burney’s supreme and full dress laureation
came at Mrs. Ord’s in Queen Anne’s Street from that
<span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span>
ancient <span class='it'>bel esprit</span> and conversationist, Soame Jenyns,
then nearing eighty, who, arriving by arrangement,
attired in a Court suit of apricot-coloured silk
lined with white satin, regaled the author of <span class='it'>Cecilia</span>
with a magnificent and magniloquent harangue upon
the merits of her work, to which the rest of
the distinguished company respectfully listened—standing!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But if <span class='it'>Cecilia</span> pleased the old wit, Soame Jenyns, it
did not equally please the old wit, Horace Walpole,
to whom it suggested many of the inconvenient objections
of the incorruptible. He thought it “immeasurably
long”; he disliked the end (as Burke did); he
found most of the personages <span class='it'>outrés</span>; he said (and, in
this instance, unanswerably) that they spoke too uniformly
in character to be true to the complexity of
human life; and he wished Albany suppressed altogether.
The book, also, he complained, “was written
in Dr. Johnson’s unnatural phrase.” Other people—either
in praise or blame—had made the same discovery.
“The particularly nervous and perspicuous
style”—wrote the <span class='it'>Monthly Review</span>—“appears to have
been framed on the best model of Dr. Johnson.” But
even among Fanny’s friends, there were those to whom
this was scarcely a merit. “The writing here and
there”—wrote Mr. Twining of Colchester to Fanny’s
father—“is not the better for a little imitation (probably
involuntary) of Dr. Johnson.” That there are
traces of the Johnsonian manner in <span class='it'>Evelina</span> has already
been observed, especially where Miss Burney writes
in her own person. In <span class='it'>Cecilia</span> these evidences would
naturally be more manifest, since the narrative form
is substituted for the epistolary. Still there is little
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>
of the Doctor in the many conversations, and the point
may easily be overlaboured. There is enough, however,
to warrant Boswell in claiming Miss Burney as
one of Johnson’s many imitators; and Lord Macaulay
picked out one passage in special which has the very
trick and turn of the great man’s pen. But when it
led Lord Macaulay to say, as he did, that he had not
the smallest doubt that Johnson had “revised” <span class='it'>Cecilia</span>,
and “retouched the style of many passages,” he was
demonstrably in error. “I never saw one word of
it before it was printed,”—the Doctor told a gentleman
who wished “to make out some credit to him from the
little rogue’s book”; and the disclaimer must surely
be accepted as decisive.<a id='r51'/><a href='#f51' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[51]</span></sup></a> At the same time, Johnson
was undoubtedly the reigning model; and, consciously
or unconsciously, Miss Burney copied him. “Fanny
carries bird-lime in her brains”—said her father—“for
everything that lights there sticks.” As the writer of
<span class='it'>Evelina</span>, she had remembered the writer of the <span class='it'>Rambler</span>;
and nothing is more reasonable than that she should
remember him all the more in <span class='it'>Cecilia</span>, when, by personal
contact and personal admiration, she had absorbed and
assimilated his method and vocabulary. Whether she
would not have done better to copy herself, is another
matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In July, 1782, when <span class='it'>Cecilia</span> was published, Fanny
Burney was thirty,—that critical age before which,
according to a discouraging dictum, those who are not
doomed to failure, must have contrived to succeed.
Hitherto, she <span class='it'>had</span> succeeded; and if a bard in the
<span class='it'>Morning Herald</span> was to be believed, had now taken
<span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span>
her place permanently in that galaxy of which Burke
had written, for</p>

Boscawen, Mrs. Thrale, and Mrs. Montagu.<a id='r52'/><a href='#f52' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[52]</span></sup></a> Her
friends were naturally anxious that she should pursue
her triumphs; and “Daddy” Crisp, while piously
enjoining her not “to remit her ardour and industry to
be perfect,” and sagaciously observing “that there had
been more instances than one, where writers have wrote
themselves down, by slovenliness, laziness, and presuming
too much on public favour for what is past,”—was
still very practically alive to the necessities of
taking the tide at the flood. “This is the harvest time
of your life,”—he wrote; “your sun shines hot; lose
not a moment, then, but make your hay directly.
‘Touch the yellow boys,’—as Briggs says—‘grow
warm’; make the booksellers come down handsomely—count
the ready—the chink.” Nevertheless, it was
fourteen years before Miss Burney published another
novel; and we must now revert to the chronicle of
her life.
<span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>There can be little doubt that the publication of
<span class='it'>Cecilia</span> largely extended the circle of her acquaintance;
and that the paternal coach must often have been in
requisition to convey her to the houses of the “lyon-hunters.”
“I begin to grow most heartily sick and
fatigued”—she writes in December, 1782—“of this
continual round of visiting, and these eternal new
acquaintances.” Elsewhere there are indications that,
for one who was not able to run milliners’ bills, the
question of costume must have been an absorbing one.
“Miss Burney”—said Mr. Cambridge—“had no time
to write, for she was always working at her clothes.”
Mr. Richard Owen Cambridge of Twickenham,—Walpole’s
“Cambridge the Everything,”—now an elderly
gentleman, was one of the new friends who seem to
have specially attracted her; and there is an account
in the <span class='it'>Diary</span> of a visit she made in the summer of 1783
to that pleasant house of his in the meadows by Richmond
Bridge, to which so many old-world notabilities
were wont to resort. One of the things she recalls is
her host’s testimony—in spite of the <span class='it'>Préjugé à la mode</span>—to
his love for his wife. “There is no sight so pleasing
to me,” he told her, “as seeing Mrs. Cambridge enter
a room; and that after having been married to her for
forty years.” At Mrs. Vesey’s she met Cambridge’s
near neighbour, Horace Walpole, whom she found
extremely entertaining. Dr. Parr, Jonas Hanway,
<span class='it'>Tasso</span> Hoole, Benjamin West, the Wartons, Mrs. Ord,
Mrs. Buller, Mrs. Chapone, Mrs. Garrick, also flit
through her pages, though it would be impossible to
make record of them here. But among the “fair
females”—as “the General” of the last chapter would
have said,—may be mentioned, chiefly because she
<span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span>
must be mentioned hereafter, Mme. de Genlis, then in
this country. To this most fascinating and insidious
personage, Miss Burney was at first much attracted.
But the acquaintance—her niece and editor tells us—was
not maintained; and Fanny afterwards made
nearer and dearer French friends for whom the multifarious
author of <span class='it'>Adèle et Théodore</span> was only “<span class='it'>cette
coquine de Brulard</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon the dissolution of the Whig Ministry at the
close of 1783, Burke, as Paymaster General, appointed
Dr. Burney organist of Chelsea Hospital Chapel, at an
increased salary of £50 per annum. It was not much,
but it was enhanced by the courteous way in which it
was done. In her father’s absence, Burke himself
informed Miss Burney of what he styled his “last act
in office.” Earlier—in the same year, 1783—had come
her first serious bereavement since she had lost her
mother,—the death of her kind old Mentor at Chessington.
By this time, Mr. Crisp was seventy-six, and had
long been a martyr to the gout to which he finally
succumbed. During his last illness, Fanny wrote to
him frequently and affectionately; and, when it grew
grave, hastened to his bed-side. She was “the dearest
thing to him on earth,” he told her with his last breath;
and her sorrow at his loss was for the time overwhelming.
In what was once the picturesque and rustic, but
is now the “restored” and “enlarged” church at Chessington,
is a mural tablet to his memory, with an
epitaph in verse by Dr. Burney, which his daughter
has printed.<a id='r53'/><a href='#f53' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[53]</span></sup></a> To Fanny the loss of “Daddy” Crisp
was incalculable, for he had been at once her most
judicious admirer and her most stimulating critic, never
<span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span>
failing to mingle blame with his praise—blame against
which, after the manner of the criticised, she generally
at first protested. He was a better counsellor than her
father, who was too eager for publication to be always
mindful of the necessity for finish. Yet, at the same
time, Crisp was urgent that his favourite should trust
her own instincts. “Who[m]soever you think fit to consult,
let their talents and tastes be ever so great, hear
what they say, allowed!—agreed!—but never give up
or alter a tittle merely on their authority, nor unless it
perfectly coincides with your own inward feelings. I
can say this to my sorrow and to my cost. But mum!”
Which last injunction was no doubt a reference to his
own ill-starred <span class='it'>Virginia</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>More than a year later took place what may almost
be regarded as another bereavement,—the second
marriage of Mrs. Thrale. With this much-discussed
event,—perplexed, moreover, by no little piqué and
wounded feeling,—we are concerned only in so far as
it relates to Miss Burney. Gabriele Piozzi, who is
sometimes contemptuously and erroneously described
as a merely obscure “fiddler,” was a musician and professional
singer of exceptional ability, who, according
to contemporary prints, was earning some £1,200 per
annum by his talents. He was a Roman Catholic, a
handsome man “with gentle, pleasing, unaffected
manners,” of unimpeachable integrity, and about six
months older than Mrs. Thrale, who, at her husband’s
death, was forty. The Thrales first made his acquaintance
at Brighton in 1780, and he speedily became a
“prodigious favourite.” After her husband’s death,
Mrs. Thrale’s liking for him gradually increased until it
became a passion. Meanwhile, in 1782, with Johnson’s
<span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span>
full concurrence, Streatham Place was let for three years
to Lord Shelburne; and after leaving it in October of
that year, the Doctor went with her for six weeks
to her Brighton house—a fact which takes off something
from the pathetic poignancy of the famous <span class='it'>adieux</span>
to Streatham, regretful and melancholy as they must
of necessity have been. Before 1782 had closed Mrs.
Thrale had determined to marry Piozzi. But her
daughters—to whom their father had left £20,000 each—were
against the match; and after much mental
perplexity, she decided to bid her lover farewell, and
did so in January 1783. The sacrifice, however, proved
beyond her powers; her health began to suffer; and a
year later, with the tacit consent of her children, Piozzi
was recalled from Milan, and she was married to him
on the 23rd July, 1784, according to the rites of the
Romish Church, by the Chaplain of the Spanish
Ambassador. A second marriage followed on the 25th
at St. James’s Church, Bath. Her correspondence with
Johnson, upon what he regarded as this “ignominious”
union, has been printed by Mr. Hayward, and <span class='it'>her</span>
letters should be read as well as those of the Doctor.<a id='r54'/><a href='#f54' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[54]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>In all these proceedings, between Fanny’s affection
for Mrs. Thrale and her affection for Dr. Johnson, she
played a delicate and a difficult part. According to
Mrs. Thrale, it was Fanny who had first introduced
Piozzi to her as “a man likely to lighten the burden of
life to her.” In October, 1782, Mrs. Thrale writes in
<span class='it'>Thraliana</span> that that “dear little discerning creature,
Fanny Burney,” says she is in love with Piozzi; and
she then goes on to argue the <span class='it'>pros</span> and <span class='it'>cons</span> with herself.
<span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>
At Brighton, just before the first farewell to Piozzi,
Mrs. Thrale admits that Fanny’s “interest as well as
judgment goes all against my marriage”—a view which
is fully confirmed by Miss Burney’s absolute refusal
to approve the course proposed, although at the same
time she found it difficult to restrain her indignation
at Queenie’s heartless attitude to her mother. Later
still, she said decidedly that Mrs. Thrale must either
marry Piozzi instantly or give him up, otherwise her
reputation would be lost. In May, 1784, Mrs. Thrale
having decided to marry Piozzi, came to London to
consult Miss Burney about details. The meeting, as
may be divined, was embarrassing to Fanny, who, in
Mrs. Thrale’s words, was as much “pained as delighted
by her visit.” Nevertheless she gave her time wholly to
her old friend, and her father was also consulted. Dr.
Burney, a brother professional himself, regarded the
matter more philosophically than some of his nicely
sensitive contemporaries. “No one”—he said—“could
blame Piozzi for accepting a gay young widow. What
could he do better?” Then came the marriage, with
a sequel which might have been foreseen. Mrs. Thrale
considered that Fanny’s congratulations upon a step
“which she had uniformly, openly, and with deep and
avowed affliction, thought wrong”—were insufficiently
cordial. The <span class='it'>Diary</span> only contains a sketch of Miss
Burney’s answer to this impeachment—an answer by
which Mrs. Piozzi, preoccupied with her own happiness,
could scarcely be gravely disturbed. She besought
her “sweetest Burney” to give herself no serious
concern in the matter, to “quiet her kind heart,”
and to love Mr. Piozzi, if she loved his wife. To
this “F. B.” sent “the warmest and most heartfelt”
<span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span>
rejoinder. And there the six years’ correspondence
ended. Miss Burney may have been right in connecting
its cessation with resentment on Piozzi’s part,
“when he was informed of her constant opposition
to the union,” but there were surely reasons enough
in the circumstances of the case to make further intercourse
difficult, if not impracticable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A heavier loss, however, than that of Mrs. Thrale,
was in store for Fanny Burney. Johnson, who was
now seventy-four, had for some time been perceptibly
failing. In the middle of 1783 he had a stroke; and
at the end of the same year, he had been very ill with
spasmodic asthma. “Ah! <span class='it'>priez Dieu pour moi!</span>”—he
had said suddenly to her, as she sat by him; and he
had been “quite touchingly affectionate.” She was his
“dearest of all dear ladies,”—he declared. A year
later he was manifestly nearing his end; and on
Thursday, the 25th November, 1784, Fanny saw him
for the last time. Though exceedingly ill, he received
her; and they had a long conversation in the old way,—about
his dead wife—about Queenie Thrale, who had
been to visit him,—about Queenie’s mother, from whom
he never hears, and to whom he never writes. “I
drive her,” he said, “quite from my mind. If I meet
with one of her letters, I burn it instantly. I have
burnt all I can find. I never speak of her, and I desire
never to hear of her more. I drive her, as I said,
wholly from my mind.”<a id='r55'/><a href='#f55' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[55]</span></sup></a> Fanny quickly changed the
<span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span>
subject; and he went on to talk of the “Bristol milk-woman,”
Ann Yearsley, a local poetess whom Hannah
More befriended,—of Shakespeare and his Caliban,
and other topics. At length, seeing he grew visibly
worse, she rose to go; and, for the first time she could
remember, he did not oppose it. But kindly pressing
both her hands, he begged her to come again—to come
soon, and to remember him in her prayers. She never
saw him afterwards, although she more than once
essayed to do so. When, two days before his death,
Dr. Burney called, the old man spoke of her tenderly,
reiterated his request about her prayers; and then,
brightening for a moment, said, almost archly, “I think
I shall throw the ball at Fanny yet!” Apparently
also, he asked to see her. But although, on the following
morning, she waited tearfully in the cold little
parlour at Bolt Court, and lingered on the stairs that led
to the back room where he lay, no summons came from
the sick man. At length arrived Bennet Langton with a
faltering message. The Doctor hoped she would excuse
him; but he felt himself too weak for such an interview.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With Johnson dead, and Crisp dead, and Mrs. Piozzi
alienated by her marriage, life—it may be imagined—must,
in these days, have seemed unusually gloomy to
Fanny Burney. But fortunately, though her feelings
were strong, her temperament was elastic. And the
successful author of <span class='it'>Cecilia</span> had now troops of friends,
both new and old. To those she respected, it was her
nature to grow rapidly and devotedly attached. Even
for some weeks before Johnson’s fatal illness, her
<span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span>
letters had been dated from Norbury—a charming
country-house upon a hill-slope in Surrey, looking
southward across the Mole and the beautiful Vale of
Mickleham, to Dorking and Box Hill. Here—in addition
to a park with a Druids’ Grove of yews that dated
from Domesday Book, and a saloon with trellised
ceiling, where the landscapes of George Barret cunningly
completed the magnificent view from the
windows—she enjoyed the companionship of a host
and hostess, who, if not as remarkable as her Streatham
friends, were at least as cultured and as kind.
Mr. Locke of Norbury was a genuine connoisseur,
who had brought the Discobolus of Myron to England,
while his son William, a youth of seventeen, was to
become a capable historical artist. Mrs. Locke,—the
“dearest Fredy” of the <span class='it'>Diary</span>, according to Miss Burney,
was “sweet and most bewitching.” At Norbury, where,
on fine days, they wandered in the grounds; or on wet
days, read Mme. de Sévigné and Captain Cook aloud in
the picture room, Fanny seems to have been thoroughly
content to “stay till she <span class='it'>must</span> go,” driving unpleasant
thought away like “a wasp near an open window.”
What was more, she was in a sense <span class='it'>en pays de connaissance</span>,
for Norbury was only six miles from that other
regretted “place of peace, ease, freedom and cheerfulness,”
Chessington Hall. During the next few months
her visits to the Lockes were frequent; and in later
years, she was to know them even better still. Meanwhile,
to her delight, her sister Susan made Mickleham
her residence, occupying with her husband and family
a little cottage on the high road at the very foot of
Norbury Park.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But besides her relations with the Lockes of Norbury,
<span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span>
she formed, at this date, another friendship, of which
the consequences, during the years that immediately
followed, were of no small importance. Early in 1783,
she had been taken by Mrs. Chapone to visit the
venerable Mrs. Delany (the widow of Swift’s friend,
Dr. Patrick Delany), then living in London at St.
James’s Place. At this time, Mrs. Delany was eighty-three,
a charming and accomplished old lady, with a
reputation for cutting out the ingenious “paper
Mosaiks” now in the British Museum; a great favourite
with King George and Queen Charlotte; and the
bosom friend of another old lady and <span class='it'>grande dame</span>,
Prior’s “Peggy,” the Dowager Duchess of Portland.
Both Mrs. Delany and her friend (who arrived shortly
after Fanny reached St. James’s Place) had been prejudiced
against <span class='it'>Cecilia</span>,—the Duchess chiefly from
recollections of the cruel depression into which she
had been thrown by the tedium and the tragedy of
Richardson’s <span class='it'>Clarissa</span>. But they had both succumbed
to Fanny’s book; they knew its characters by heart;
told stories how lords and prelates had discussed the
incidents and the characters, and finally crowned their
commendations by praising its excellent tone and
morality. “No book”—said Mrs. Delany—“ever was
so useful as this, because none other that is so good
was ever so much read.” And the Duchess and Mrs.
Chapone said <span class='it'>ditto</span> to Mrs. Delany. Mrs. Chapone, by
the way, told an interesting anecdote. Someone, she
said, had been protesting that there could be no such
character as Briggs, whom not only Queen Charlotte but
Mrs. Thrale had regarded as exaggerated.<a id='r56'/><a href='#f56' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[56]</span></sup></a> Thereupon
<span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>
“a poor, little mean city man” in company had “started
up, and said—‘But there is though, for I’se one myself.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The friendship thus inaugurated speedily became
enduring; and Fanny’s record for 1784 contains more
than one reference to days spent at St. James’s Place,
sometimes <span class='it'>en tête-à-tête</span>, when she was allowed to
rummage Mrs. Delany’s correspondence with Swift and
Young or listen to her old stories of the notabilities
of the first half of the century. In July, 1785, the
Duchess of Portland died; and the loss drew Fanny
closer to her new friend. Another result of the
Duchess’s death was, that it deprived Mrs. Delany of
the summer quarters which she had for so many years
enjoyed at Bulstrode, the seat of the Portlands near
Beaconsfield. Upon learning this, the King and Queen,
whose affection for Mrs. Delany seems to have been
of the most genuine kind, offered her a small house
near the gate of Windsor Castle, which, with the
greatest forethought, they immediately stocked and
put in order for her, the King himself personally
superintending the workmen. They also gave her a
pension of £300 a year, which, in order that it might
escape taxation, the good-natured Queen herself was
accustomed to hand to her half-yearly in a pocket-book.
Pending Mrs. Delany’s removal to Windsor, Fanny was
<span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span>
often in attendance on her, either as companion or
sympathiser. When, at last, she departed, Fanny
went to Norbury, and elsewhere. But in November,
1785, she was again “domesticated” with Mrs. Delany
at Windsor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the first things which she heard upon her
arrival was, that Their Majesties had been expecting
her. All the Princesses were coming to see her—she
was told. Moreover, the Queen, stimulated by Mme.
de Genlis’ praises of Miss Burney, had been re-reading
<span class='it'>Cecilia</span>, or rather having it read to her by one of her
readers, the Swiss geologist, M. de Luc. (As M. de
Luc could hardly speak four words of English, this
must have been unfortunate for <span class='it'>Cecilia</span>.) The book
had also been read to the Princess Elizabeth. These
announcements, and the particular inquiries which
the King and Queen did not cease to make about
her of Mrs. Delany, naturally filled Fanny with all her
customary trepidations, real and imaginary. Owing,
however, to the illness of the Princess Elizabeth and
other causes, the meeting did not at once take place.
Then suddenly, on Friday, December 16, “a large
man, in deep mourning,” and with a star glittering on
his breast, made sudden apparition in Mrs. Delany’s
drawing room, throwing its occupants into petrified
confusion. It was King George himself. He spoke
very kindly to Miss Burney, showing much benevolent
consideration for her nervousness; but overwhelmed
her presently by questions after the “What! What!”
fashion, made familiar by the <span class='it'>Probationary Odes</span> and
the irreverent performances of “Peter Pindar.” How
did she write <span class='it'>Evelina</span>—and why? Why did she not
tell her father? How was it printed? Why had she
<span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'></span>
done nothing more since <span class='it'>Cecilia</span>? To which last
Fanny answered demurely and hesitatingly that she
believed she had exhausted herself,—a reply which
was received in the light of a <span class='it'>bon mot</span>. During the
progress of this inquisition, which is recorded with
extreme minuteness, arrived Queen Charlotte, to whom
His Majesty forthwith carefully recapitulated his conversation
with Miss Burney. The Queen, who was very
soft-voiced and gracious, was equally curious. She
wished much to know if there was to be “nothing more”;
and she was good enough to express a desire that there
should be something. From what had been done, she
thought there was a power to do good. And good to
young people was so very good a thing, that she could
not help wishing it could be. Thereupon the King—as
one behind the scenes—proceeded to assure her that
Miss Burney had made no vow not to write;—it was
only a question of inclination—was it not? They were,
both of them, evidently prepossessed in favour of Mrs.
Delany’s young friend, who, on her side, does ample
justice to the unaffected, gentle dignity of Queen
Charlotte; the <span class='it'>bonhomie</span>, good spirits, and friendly
kindness of the King; and the fondness of the royal
couple for one another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few days later, the King came again to tea,
chatting very freely in his discursive way of many
things,—of Mme. de Genlis’ knowledge of English; of
the “monster” Voltaire; of the pride and ingratitude
of Rousseau (to whom His Majesty had given a
pension). But here Miss Burney was able to acquaint
him, on her father’s authority, that M. Jean-Jacques
kept His Majesty’s portrait over his chimney at Paris.
Then the King passed to the recent death of Kitty
<span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span>
Clive;<a id='r57'/><a href='#f57' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[57]</span></sup></a> and the merits of Mrs. Siddons, whom he
ranked above Garrick—an opinion from which Fanny
could of course only mutely dissent. Shakespeare
came next; and His Majesty—as is known—had the
courage of his opinions. “Was there ever such stuff
as great part of Shakespeare? only one must not say
so!—But what think you?—What?—Is there not sad
stuff?—What?—What?” And he instanced several
plays and characters in support of his heresies. Fanny
told him how Mme. de Genlis had declared that no
woman ought to go to any of the English comedies,—an
aspersion of the national stage which was resented
with much animation by the discerning critic who
had twice ordered the representation of <span class='it'>She Stoops to
Conquer</span>. In a further “private conference” with his
consort, there was more talk of Mme. de Genlis, who,
it seems, always sent her “moral page” to Queen
Charlotte;—of the <span class='it'>Sorrows of Werther</span>, which neither she
nor Fanny admired as the great Napoleon did;—of an
unnamed but meritorious work picked up for her upon
a stall by one of her servants. “It is amazing what
good books there are on stalls”—said the Queen—an
utterance which should canonise her for ever with the
book-hunter. She afterwards spoke of Klopstock’s
<span class='it'>Messiah</span>, criticising the author’s engraftments upon the
sacred story; and then gave an account of the Protestant
nunneries in Germany, to one of which she had
belonged,—of the rigid rules of entrance,—of the
internal economy,—of the costume. The record of
the interview breaks off abruptly; but it leaves a
pleasant impression of Queen Charlotte’s amenity,
humour, and conversational powers.
<span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>This meeting took place on December 20th, 1785,
after which Miss Burney went home. She paid another
visit to Windsor in the May following with her father,
who was anxious to obtain the then-vacant post of
Master of the King’s Band. To this end he was
recommended to show himself to the King, when he
walked upon the Terrace at Windsor; but not to make
direct solicitation. Unhappily, the place had already
been promised by the Lord Chamberlain; and though
both the King and Queen spoke amiably to Miss
Burney, the expedition was without effect. Very
shortly afterwards, by the resignation of Mrs. Haggerdorn,
Second Keeper of Robes, a vacancy occurred
in the Royal Household. Mrs. Haggerdorn’s place
was much sought after, even by persons of fashion and
rank. But the Queen had taken a fancy to Mrs.
Delany’s visitor, and offered it to Miss Burney. By
Fanny herself the proposition was received with consternation.
The separation from her family circle, the
close confinement to the Court, the permanent character
of an engagement so made, the wearisome “life of
attendance and dependence”—we are using her own
words—all these things she considered were unsuited to
her inclinations, and unfavourable to her happiness. But
her friends—who, it is only fair to remember, knew
her literary limitations, and were better instructed as
to her literary gains than some of her earlier critics—took
a different view of the matter. The Lockes and
her sister, Mrs. Phillips, had, indeed, always expected
some such development of her Windsor visits: Mrs.
Delany—a courtier in grain—was naturally transported;
while her father (in whose hands she dutifully
placed herself), and even Burke, regarded the royal
<span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span>
offer as affording a certain prospect of an honourable
and advantageous establishment for life. It was
accordingly accepted, after an interview with the
Queen, who, in the face of all the Windsor place-hunters,
had made her own choice. “I was led to
think of Miss Burney”—Her Majesty told Mrs.
Delany—“first by her books; then by seeing her;
then by always hearing how she was loved by her
friends; but chiefly by your friendship for her.” Of
Fanny herself, Queen Charlotte asked no questions,
only saying pleasantly—“I am sure we shall do very
well together.”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER VI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE QUEEN’S DRESSER</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'>On the 6th of July, 1786, the <span class='it'>Public Advertiser</span> announced
that—“Miss Burney, daughter of Dr. Burney,
is appointed Dresser to the Queen, in the room of Mrs.
Hoggadore, gone to Germany.” The last three words
were premature, for further notifications, with much
pleasing and ingenious variation of Mrs. Haggerdorn’s
name, made it clear that the lady in question only took
leave of the Queen on the 13th, and retired to her
native Mecklenburg on the 17th. She is described in
the public print aforesaid as Her Majesty’s “confidential
companion and dresser”; but in the Court
Register she figures as one of two “Keepers of Robes,”
the Senior Keeper being a Mrs. Schwellenberg (or
Schwellenbergen), who, with Mrs. Haggerdorn, had
accompanied the Queen from Germany five and twenty
years earlier. To Mrs. Haggerdorn’s post, with some
modification of duties, Miss Burney now succeeded,
entering upon her office on the 17th July. As—for
lack of repairs—Windsor Castle had been for some
years uninhabitable, the Royal Family were at this
time domiciled in two temporary buildings, described
indifferently by topographers as “mansions” and
“barracks.” These had been built for the King by
<span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span>
Sir William Chambers. The larger, the Upper or
Queen’s Lodge,<a id='r58'/><a href='#f58' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[58]</span></sup></a> so called from its occupying the site
of a former Queen Anne’s Lodge, was appropriated to
Queen Charlotte, King George and the two elder
Princesses—the Princess Royal and the Princess
Augusta. It stood to the south east of the Castle,
almost facing the South Terrace. Behind it was a
large walled garden, where Herschel exhibited newly
discovered comets to the Court; and at the end of
this garden was the second or Lower Lodge, allotted to
the younger branches of the Royal Family. Both
these structures were of stuccoed red brick, with
embattled copings. They were draughty and cold in
winter. Miss Burney’s apartments, a bed-room and a
large drawing-room, were on the ground-floor in the
Upper Lodge. The drawing-room looked on the
Round Tower and the Terrace; and was probably at
the eastern corner, as she speaks of its opening at the
farther side, from the windows, to the Little Park,
which lay to the north and east of the Castle. The
bed-room (which was entered from the sitting-room)
looked into the garden. Immediately above her were
the rooms of her colleague, Mrs. Schwellenberg.
Fanny describes her quarters as “airy, pleasant, clean
and healthy,” “delightfully independent of all the rest
of the house,” and as containing “everything I can
desire for my convenience and comfort.” Mrs. Delany
<span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span>
was not fifty yards away; and she could readily obtain
access to the South Terrace by a special flight of steps.
At Kew, to which Their Majesties frequently migrated,
she had also her special accommodation, rather contracted,
after the fashion of the place, but “tidy and
comfortable enough”; and at St. James’s Palace she
occupied rooms, one of which looked over the Park.
From other indications, it appears that she had her
special man-servant; and, in common with Mrs.
Schwellenberg, the use of a carriage. Her salary was
£200 a year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a week, she began to realise her position and
to draw up “a concise abstract of the general method
of passing the day.” Concise though it be, it is too
detailed to be reproduced entire, but must be further
summarised as follows:—She rose at six, awaiting her
first summons, which generally came at half-past seven,
after the Queen’s hair had been dressed by Mrs.
Thielky, her wardrobe-woman. Then, with Mrs.
Thielky’s aid, she dresses the Queen, Mrs. Thielky’s
office being to hand Fanny the things as they are
required,—a fortunate detail, since, as she says, she
might run “a prodigious risk of giving the gown before
the hoop, or the fan before the neckerchief.” By
eight the dressing is ended, and the Queen, with the
King and Princesses, proceeds to the King’s Chapel to
prayers, while Fanny goes to breakfast, dawdling meanwhile
over a book—for the moment, Gilpin’s <span class='it'>Observations</span>
on the Lake District, which Mrs. Delany has lent
her. At nine she meditates upon her next immediate
business, which generally resolves itself into questions
of costume. This done, she is generally her own
mistress until a quarter to twelve, occupying the time,
<span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>
if it be not absorbed by the aforesaid questions of
costume, in writing or walking. At a quarter before
one the Queen usually dresses for the day, when Mrs.
Schwellenberg, as well as the “inferior priestesses,” is
present. The Queen is powdered by her hairdresser,
during which time she reads the newspaper. “When
she observes that I have run to her but half dressed,
she constantly gives me leave to return and finish as
soon as she is seated. If she is grave, and reads
steadily on, she dismisses me, whether I am dressed or
not; but at all times she never forgets to send me
away while she is powdering, with a consideration not
to spoil my clothes, that one would not expect belonged
to her high station. Neither does she ever detain me
without making a point of reading some little paragraph
aloud.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a short time Fanny is again summoned, and
her further attendance, transferred to the state dressing-room
(“if any room in this private mansion can
have the epithet of state”), lasts until about three, after
which she sees no more of the Queen until bed-time.
At five, dinner <span class='it'>en tête-à-tête</span> with Mrs. Schwellenberg
follows in the eating-room, after which coffee in that
lady’s apartment takes until eight. At eight, descent
once more to the eating-room, when the Equerry in
Waiting, together with any friend invited by the King
or Queen, arrives for tea, which takes till nine. “From
that time,”—continues Fanny—“if Mrs. Schwellenberg
is alone, I never quit her for a minute till I come to
my little supper at near eleven. Between eleven and
twelve my last summons usually takes place, earlier
and later occasionally. Twenty minutes is the customary
time then spent with the Queen: half an hour, I
<span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'></span>
believe, is seldom exceeded. I then come back and after
doing whatever I can to forward my dress for the next
morning, I go to bed—and to sleep, too, believe me:
the early rising, and a long day’s attention to new
affairs and occupations, cause a fatigue so bodily, that
nothing mental stands against it, and to sleep I fall the
moment I have put out my candle and laid down my
head.” To these details, it is only necessary to add
that the summonses in question were made by a bell
(which seems at first to have given Fanny a good deal
of annoyance); and that it was also a part of her duties
to mix the Queen’s snuff,—a task which she is recorded
to have performed extremely well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the above account, it may be gathered that
attendance on Queen Charlotte was by no means the
most onerous of Miss Burney’s functions. Occupying
chiefly the middle of the day, it could only have
been on Wednesdays and Saturdays (when there were
special duties) that it extended to more than four
hours, besides which Her Majesty seems to have
been laudably solicitous, at all times, to spare her
new and very untried attendant. But in Fanny’s
<span class='it'>carte du jour</span> there is decidedly an “intolerable
deal” of Schwellenberg. Six mortal hours of daily
intercourse with this estimable lady, in addition to
collaborating with her in what Fanny calls “the irksome
and quick-returning labours” of the royal toilette,
must have been a cruel penance, only made bearable
by Mrs. Schwellenberg’s frequent absences on sick
leave. Had Mrs. Schwellenberg been a Mrs. Delany,
it would not have mattered so much. But she was
simply a peevish old person of uncertain temper and
impaired health, swaddled in the buckram of backstairs
<span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span>
etiquette, captious, arrogant, ignorant, and accustomed—like
Mrs. Slipslop—to console herself for her servility
to her betters by her rudeness to those beneath
her. She was blindly devoted to the Royal Family;
but of taste and education she had nothing. Novels and
romances she professed to regard as “what you call
stuff”;<a id='r59'/><a href='#f59' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[59]</span></sup></a> and the only book she was known to favour was
Josephus, which was “quoted to solve all difficulties.”
Her chief enthusiasm was for a pair of pet frogs which
croaked when she tapped her snuff-box. “When I
only go so .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. knock, knock, knock, they croak all
what I please,” she would cry in an ecstasy; and she
never wearied of dilating upon their “endearing little
qualities” and their healthy appetite for the live flies
caught for them by M. de Luc. Although she had
been a quarter of a century in England, she still spoke
a broken jargon, irresistible to the mimic. She was
without conversational gifts, yet she could not endure
a moment’s silence; she was without resources or
power of attraction, yet she was furious at the least
suspicion of neglect. Moreover, she seems to have
lived in perpetual apprehension of obscure impending
spasms, which could only be dissipated by cards.
And Fanny hated cards. In moments of irritation,
the old lady was capable of the meanest petty
tyrannies; in her hours of ease, her amiability to her
“good Miss Bernar” was as profuse as it was unpalatable.
Several of her objectionable acts are narrated
in the <span class='it'>Diary</span>; but it is needless to recall them; and the
<span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span>
situation was obviously complicated by a perhaps
intelligible jealousy on the part of the elder woman.
Years afterwards, when the <span class='it'>Diary</span> was first published,
the Duke of Sussex thought that its writer was “rather
hard on poor old Schwellenberg”; and it is not
impossible that Miss Burney may have somewhat
heightened her delineation of a character which
afforded so many inviting aspects of attack. Yet,
though “Cerbera” or “La Présidente”—as Fanny
calls her—may not have been as black as she is painted,
it would be hopeless to attempt to decorate her with
wings; and there can be little doubt that the happiest
hours of the Junior Keeper were those when her
untuneable colleague was safely laid up in London or
Weymouth with the gout.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortunately for Miss Burney all her associates were
not of the Schwellenberg type. Miss Planta, English
teacher to the two elder Princesses; Miss Goldsworthy
(familiarly “Goully”), the sub-governess; Mme. la
Fite, who read French to the Queen; and Mme. de
Luc, the wife of the fly-catcher, were all amiable
enough. And several of the successive Equerries in
Waiting, if not actually qualified to regale Mrs.
Haggerdorn’s successor with that “celestial colloquy
sublime,” to which Lord Macaulay makes reference,
were at least English gentlemen, with pleasant idiosyncrasies
of their own, not wholly unworthy of study.
There was Miss Goldsworthy’s brother, Colonel Philip
Goldsworthy, a wag in his way, who relates how the
King ineffectually endeavoured to make him carouse
on barley water after a hard day’s hunting; and who
gave a dismally picturesque account of winter service
in the ill-constructed Queen’s Lodge, where there must
<span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span>
have been as many distinct and several draughts as there
are smells in the City of Cologne. There is the “Colonel
Welbred” of the record,—Colonel Fulke Greville,—quiet,
polite and undemonstrative; there is Colonel
Manners, a good-humoured, careless rattle, who says
whatever comes into his head, and thinks he might
manage to sing the 104th Psalm if he could only keep
from running into “God Save the King”; there is
the “Jessamy Bride’s” handsome husband, Colonel
Gwyn; there is Major Price; there is the Queen’s
Vice Chamberlain, the Hon. Stephen Digby (“Colonel
Fairly”), grave, scrupulous, diffident, gentle, sentimental,
and “assiduously attentive in his manners.” He
is at present married to Lord Ilchester’s daughter, by
whom he has four children; but is soon to be a widower.
Lastly, absorbing many pages of the record, is “Mr.
Turbulent,” otherwise the Rev. Charles de Guiffardière
or Giffardier, the Queen’s French reader, a <span class='it'>farceur</span> of the
first order, who, apparently to indemnify himself for
the penitential monotony of his past relations with
Mrs. Haggerdorn,—a molluscous personage whom he
contemptuously styles “the Oyster,”—indulges Miss
Burney with the most fantastic disquisitions, flights
of rodomontade and mock adoration. Macaulay roundly
writes this gentleman down “half witted,” which is
too sweeping; while the charitable Croker opines that
he was laughing at Fanny. Miss Burney’s own later
verdict upon “Mr. Turbulent” is, that he was “here
and there a little eccentric, but, in the main, merely
good-humoured and high-spirited.”<a id='r60'/><a href='#f60' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[60]</span></sup></a>
<span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In thus bringing some of the personages of the <span class='it'>Diary</span>
before the reader, it has naturally been necessary to
anticipate. The narrative of Miss Burney’s life at
Court is excessively minute; and the chronicle,
interesting as it may be in its place, does not always
concern what is the prime object of this volume,—the
story of her life. One of the first things, for instance,
which she has to set down—indeed it happened before
she had been three weeks in office—is mad Peg
Nicholson’s attempt on the King’s life, an event which,
of course, belongs to history. But Miss Burney’s pages
add to the story some of those vivid minor details
which the daughter of Mnemosyne forgets. She shows
us the admirable composure of King George amid his
terrified and tearful household; she shows him cheerfully
insisting on the usual terrace walk with a single
equerry,—on the usual evening concert. But “nothing
was listened to,”—says Miss Burney of this latter,—“scarce
a word was spoken; the Princesses wept continually;
the Queen, still more deeply struck, could
only, from time to time, hold out her hand to the
King, and say ‘I have you yet.’ ” To this we may
oppose another and more smiling passage. A few days
later came the birthday of the little Princess Amelia;
and Fanny’s account gives a good idea of one of the
popular “terracings” above referred to. “It was
really a mighty pretty procession,” she says. “The
little Princess, just turned of three years old, in a
robe-coat covered with fine muslin, a dressed close cap,
<span class='pageno' title='154' id='Page_154'></span>
white gloves, and a fan, walked on alone and first,
highly delighted in the parade, and turning from side
to side to see everybody as she passed: for all the
terracers stand up against the walls to make a clear
passage for the Royal Family, the moment they come
in sight.” Then followed the pleased King and Queen
with the remainder of the Princesses,—the Princess
Royal, the Princesses Augusta, Elizabeth, Mary,
Sophia, and their attendants; then, at a little distance,
Major Price, the Equerry in Waiting, bringing up the
rear to keep off the crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Burney was on the terrace with Mrs. Delany,
who had been carried in her chair to the foot of the
steps. At sight of Fanny’s companion, “the King
instantly stopped to speak to her. The Queen, of
course, and the little Princess, and all the rest, stood
still, in their ranks. They talked a good while with
the sweet old lady, during which time the King once
or twice addressed himself to me. I caught the
Queen’s eye, and saw in it a little surprise, but by no
means any displeasure to see me of the party. The
little Princess went up to Mrs. Delany, of whom she is
very fond, and behaved like a little angel to her: she
then, with a look of enquiry and recollection, slowly,
of her own accord, came behind Mrs. Delany to look at
me. ‘I am afraid,’ said I, in a whisper, and stooping
down, ‘your Royal Highness does not remember me?’
What think you was her answer? An arch little smile,
and a nearer approach, with her lips pouted out to kiss
me. I could not resist so innocent an invitation; but
the moment I had accepted it I was half afraid it might
seem, in so public a place, an improper liberty; however,
there was no help for it. She then took my fan,
<span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span>
and having looked at it on both sides, gravely returned
it to me, saying, ‘O, a brown fan!’ The King and
Queen then bid her curtsey to Mrs. Delany, which she
did most gracefully, and they all moved on; each of
the Princesses speaking to Mrs. Delany as they passed,
and condescending to curtsey to her companion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the next things related is a royal visit to
Nuneham (Lord Harcourt’s), which included excursions
to Oxford and Blenheim. Miss Burney was one of the
party, but—to use a phrase of Horace Walpole—did
not greatly feel the joy of it, owing to the many discomforts
and fatigues arising out of the defective
arrangements which had been made for the Royal
Suite. Mrs. Schwellenberg had assured her that she
should “appear for nobody,” and the assurance was
very literally carried out. It was in connection with
this Nuneham trip that occurred the incident of the
gown which has so much exercised some of Fanny’s
biographers. Just before the visit took place, Mrs.
Schwellenberg informed “Miss Bernar,” with much
patronising importance, that she was to have a gown,
as the Queen said she was not rich. Fanny protested
that [like Dogberry] she had two gowns, and did not
need another. “Miss Bernar,” said the scandalised
old lady, “I tell you once, when the Queen will give
you a gown, you must be humble, thankful, when
[even if] you are Duchess of Ancaster,”—<span class='it'>i.e.</span> Mistress of
the Robes. Further, she was not to be allowed to
thank the Queen herself. “When I give you the
gown,” added Mrs. Schwellenberg, “I will tell you
when you may make your curtsey”—and then for the
time the disagreeable conversation stopped. It does
not appear that Fanny got her gown in time for
<span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span>
Nuneham, as she went in a Chambéry gauze of her
own. But it is an error to say—as Lord Macaulay
does—that Queen Charlotte’s promise was “never
performed,” for a few days later, in September, we
find her wearing her “memorable present-gown” in
honour of the birthday of the Princess Royal. It was
“a lilac tabby,” we are told; and the King professed
to admire it greatly, calling out that “Emily
[<span class='it'>i.e.</span> the Princess Amelia] should see Miss Burney’s
gown now, and she would think her fine enough.”
But from a subsequent entry, it appears that it had
been given through Mrs. Schwellenberg, for Miss
Burney refers to the far greater pleasure that she
received from a gift of violets presented to her by the
Queen herself. Lord Macaulay, in his unwillingness
to believe that Miss Burney obtained any “extraordinary
benefactions” from Their Majesties, also
overlooked the fact that, both in 1787, and 1788,
Miss Burney received (though always through Mrs.
Schwellenberg) New Year’s presents from the Queen.
On the first occasion it was “a complete set of very
beautiful white and gold china for tea, and a coffee-pot,
tea-pot, cream-jug, and milk-jug of silver, in forms
remarkably pretty.” In 1788 it was a gift of plate.<a id='r61'/><a href='#f61' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[61]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>Life at Court, whether at Kew, Windsor, or London,
was not riotously eventful, and it has often been
described. The usual humdrum routine repeated
itself, diversified only by concerts, birthdays, and
<span class='pageno' title='157' id='Page_157'></span>
change of equerries. During much of the latter part
of 1786, Mrs. Schwellenberg was ill, and Fanny
reigned in her stead over the Windsor tea-table.
Early in 1787, the Court went to London, taking up
its abode at St. James’s Palace. During this time,
Miss Burney also was occasionally ill, and went home
for change. Once she visited Drury Lane with the
Royal Family; and was startled by a complimentary
reference to herself in the Epilogue to Holcroft’s
<span class='it'>Seduction</span>—“a very clever piece,”—she says,—“but
containing a dreadful picture of vice and dissipation
in high life.” The reference was to “sweet <span class='it'>Cecilia</span>,”—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<div class='literal-container' style=''><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“Whose every passion yields to Reason’s laws,”<a id='r62'/><a href='#f62' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[62]</span></sup></a>—</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>and seems to have delighted her Royal Master and
Mistress as much as—we are assured—it embarrassed
and disconcerted herself. “I took a peep at you!”
said the kind King later,—“I could not help that. I
wanted to see how you looked when your father first
discovered your writing—and now I think I know!”
Not very long subsequently, she had a compliment on
the subject of <span class='it'>Cecilia</span> from another quarter. Mrs.
Siddons, who was staying in the neighbourhood of
Windsor, was ordered to the Lodge to read a play;
and Fanny was requested by the Queen to receive her.
Almost the first thing the other Queen—the stage
Queen—said to Miss Burney was, that “there was no
part she had ever so much wished to act as that
of Cecilia.” Notwithstanding this most conciliatory
speech, Mrs. Siddons—stately and beautiful as she
<span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span>
was—does not appear to have impressed <span class='it'>Cecilia’s</span>
author. “I found her”—says Fanny—“the Heroine
of a Tragedy,—sublime, elevated, and solemn. In
face and person, truly noble and commanding; in
manners, quiet and stiff; in voice, deep and dragging;
and in conversation, formal, sententious, calm and dry.
I expected her to have been all that is interesting; the
delicacy and sweetness with which she seizes every
opportunity to strike and to captivate upon the stage
had persuaded me that her mind was formed with that
peculiar susceptibility which, in different modes, must
give equal powers to attract and to delight in common
life. But I was very much mistaken.” The play Mrs.
Siddons read was Vanbrugh and Cibber’s <span class='it'>Provoked
Husband</span>. As Fanny did not hear it, we have no
account of its effect. But it would be interesting to
know whether the entire absence of applause on these
occasions, which so paralysed the mercurial Garrick,
had the same effect on the majestic Mrs. Siddons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this way, what Fanny calls the “dead and tame
life I now lead,”—of which the above was one of the
rare variations,—went on as before, although there are
signs in her Journal now and then, that it was sometimes
less irksome to her. Indeed, on one occasion
she goes so far as to write that she has now thoroughly
formed her mind to her situation. “I even think”—she
adds—“I now should do ill to change it; for
though my content with it has been factitious, I
believe it, in the main, suited to save me from more
disturbance than it gives me.” With ampler space, it
would be easy to fill a considerable number of pages
by the vagaries of “Mr. Turbulent,” the divers
humours of the equerries, and the whims of Mrs.
<span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span>
Schwellenberg, who vacillates between endeavouring
to kill her colleague by making her sit in a draught of
a carriage window, and to conciliate her by the premature
legacy of a sedan chair. But in the limits
assigned to this chapter we can only hope to chronicle
the more important events.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of these was the trial of Warren Hastings,
which began in February, 1788, in Westminster Hall.
The Queen gave Fanny two tickets for the box of the
Grand Chamberlain (Sir Peter Burrell), where she was
just above the prisoner, whose pale and harassed face
she could see distinctly with her glass when he looked
up. Concerning the “high crimes and misdemeanours”
alleged against him, she knew nothing, regarding the
whole matter “as a party affair.” But her sympathies,
like those of the Royal Household, were provisionally
with Hastings, whom she had met two years earlier at
the Cambridges at Twickenham, and had liked,—circumstances
which she found somewhat embarrassing
when presently she saw her other friend, Burke, with
knit brows and scroll in hand, making portentous entry
at the head of the Committee for the Prosecution.
Great part of the first day’s proceedings was taken
up by the interminably tedious over-reading of the
charges; but Mr. Windham, one of the Committee,
and her sister Charlotte’s neighbour in Norfolk,<a id='r63'/><a href='#f63' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[63]</span></sup></a>
<span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span>
speedily asked to be presented to her; and, from
time to time, visited the Grand Chamberlain’s box,
pointing out the different notabilities,—among the rest,
Hastings’ arch-enemy, Philip Francis. Mr. Windham,
who was a man of the world and a brilliant talker,
made himself extremely agreeable, though he was probably
not so convincingly impressed by Miss Burney’s
instinctive conviction of the innocence of the late
Governor General of Bengal as she imagined. A
little later, she went again to Westminster Hall to
hear Burke, her companion upon this occasion being
her brother James. It was the second day of Burke’s
speech,—the first she had not heard. What she did
hear surpassed her expectations; and what she says
is confirmed by other auditors of that splendid oratory.
She notes its inequality,—its digressions. But, she
goes on—not without a touch of the Johnsonian
“triptology”—“when he narrated, he was easy,
flowing and natural; when he declaimed, energetic,
warm and brilliant. The sentiments he interspersed
were as nobly conceived as they were highly coloured;
his satire had a poignancy of wit that made it as entertaining
as it was penetrating; his allusions and quotations,
as far as they were English and within my reach,
were apt and ingenious; and the wild and sudden
flights of his fancy, bursting forth from his creative
imagination in language fluent, forcible, and varied,
had a charm for my ear and my attention wholly new
and perfectly irresistible.” In fact, she continues,
“the whirlwind of his eloquence nearly drew me into
its vortex.” Upon a third occasion, she heard Charles
<span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span>
Fox raging for five hours at the Lords, who, in the
opinion of the Committee, were favouring the accused.
But Fanny thought Fox’s face looked hard and callous,
and that Burke’s method of speaking was more gentleman-like,
scholar-like, and fraught with true genius
than that of Fox. On each of these visits, it should
be added, she had much talk with Mr. Windham,
who, for further recommendation, had been one of
Johnson’s devotees; and she made careful report of
her impressions to Queen Charlotte.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another person to whom her accounts of the first
scenes of the Great Trial had been specially welcome
was now soon to be lost to her. On the 15th of
April, 1788, not long after the above events, died
Mrs. Delany. Her death was a serious blow to Fanny,
who had resorted to her freely for sympathy when
things went wrong either with the Senior Keeper,
or in the “nice conduct” of the Equerries’ tea-table.
In the July following, the King, whose health had
hitherto been of the best, showed the first indications
of that malady which was afterwards to be of so
serious a character. As a consequence, it was decided
that, in company with the Queen and the three elder
Princesses, he should go to Cheltenham to drink the
waters,—carrying with him the Royal household in
concentrated form. Fanny and Miss Planta were of
the party; Colonel Gwyn was the Equerry in Waiting;
and Colonel Digby attended in his capacity of Queen’s
Vice-Chamberlain. They were domiciled at Fauconberg
Hall (Bay’s Hill Lodge), which was charmingly situated,
but ridiculously restricted in point of accommodation.
At Cheltenham, King George repeated his usual simple
life, promenading daily in the Walks to the delight of
<span class='pageno' title='162' id='Page_162'></span>
the lieges; and from time to time making flying visits
in the neighbourhood from which Miss Planta and
Miss Burney were, of necessity, excluded. One result
of these proceedings was to throw Miss Burney very
much into the society of Colonel Digby, now a recently
bereft and melancholy widower with a young family.
The Queen’s Vice-Chamberlain was ten years older
than Miss Burney; and rumour was already connecting
his name with that of his eventual second wife, Miss
Charlotte Gunning, a pretty Maid of Honour, who
figures in the <span class='it'>Diary</span> as “Miss Fuzelier,” and was the
eldest daughter of a baronet. Meanwhile, in the contracted
limits of Bay’s Hill Lodge, both Colonel Digby
and Miss Burney—like fellow-sufferers upon a raft—seem
to have discovered that they had much in common.
They exchanged ideas upon many subjects, staidly
discussing religion and the affections, and particularly
the second volume of a work with the “injudicious”
title of <span class='it'>Original Love Letters</span>.<a id='r64'/><a href='#f64' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[64]</span></sup></a> Fanny was admittedly
much “flattered” by the Colonel’s attraction to her little
parlour; and in her <span class='it'>Diary</span> the record of this pleasant
oasis in her pilgrimage has all the aspect of a decorous
sentimental idyll. Unhappily, practical confirmation
of the doleful Colonel’s standing topic—“the assured
misery of all stations and all seasons in this vain and
restless world”—arrived suddenly with a fit of the gout.
This effectually put a stop to any further study of
Akenside’s <span class='it'>Odes</span> and Falconer’s <span class='it'>Shipwreck</span>; and on the
8th of August Colonel Digby was forced to obtain sick
<span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>
leave, and departed. Almost immediately afterwards,
and not entirely without Fanny’s good offices,—he was
appointed to the vacant Mastership of St. Catherine’s
Hospital, a sinecure in the Queen’s gift. With this,
what Fanny styles, in a double sense, “the Cheltenham
episode” drew to an end; and the Royal Household
went back to the “set, gray life” of old. To
make matters worse, before a few weeks were over,
the King was again indisposed. In October those
about him were vaguely uneasy; and in the night of
the 20th, he was alarmingly ill. This attack however
passed off; and on the 25th the Court moved from
Kew to Windsor. On that day Miss Burney had “a
sort of conference” with the King, which she explains
to mean that she “was the object to whom he spoke.”
Though he was as gracious and kind as usual, she
was shocked at the hoarseness, volubility, and even
vehemence of his speech. The next day she met him
again in the passage from the Queen’s room. “He stopped
me, and conversed upon his health near half an hour,
still with that extreme quickness of speech and manner
that belongs to fever; and he hardly sleeps, he tells
me, one minute all night; indeed, if he recovers not
his rest, a most delirious fever seems to threaten him.
He is all agitation, all emotion, yet all benevolence and
goodness, even to a degree that makes it touching to
hear him speak. He assures everybody of his health;
he seems only fearful to give uneasiness to others, yet
certainly he is better than last night. Nobody speaks
of his illness, nor what they think of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the next few days, notwithstanding that the King
seemed sometimes better than at other times, he grew
steadily worse. He became appreciably weaker; he
<span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span>
walked like a gouty man; he had talked away all his
voice, and his hoarseness was pitiful to hear. Nevertheless
he was as amiable as ever:—“he seemed to have
no anxiety but to set the Queen at rest, and no wish but
to quiet and give pleasure to all around him.” In the
meantime the poor Queen is overcome with nameless
apprehension; walks up and down the room without
uttering a word, shaking her head in manifest distress
and irresolution. So matters wear on until the 3rd
November when Dr. Heberden is called in, “for
counsel [it is announced], not that His Majesty is
worse.” Yet on the following day the Queen is in
deeper distress than before; the King is in a state
almost incomprehensible; and all the household is uneasy
and alarmed. On the 5th, His Majesty goes out for
an airing with the Princess Royal; and the Prince of
Wales arrives from Brighton. Then between six and
seven, an inexplicable stillness comes upon the Upper
Lodge, as if something had happened. No one stirs;
no one speaks. The evening concert is stopped. The
equerries are gloomy and uncommunicative, though it
is vaguely understood that the King is much worse,
and that the Queen herself has been taken ill. At last
Miss Burney learns the truth from the Vice-Chamberlain.
At dinner His Majesty had broken into a positive fit of
delirium, and the Queen had been in violent hysterics.
“All the Princesses were in misery, and the Prince of
Wales had burst into tears.<a id='r65'/><a href='#f65' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[65]</span></sup></a> No one knew what was
to follow—no one could conjecture the event.”
<span class='pageno' title='165' id='Page_165'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>What did follow has been told and retold, and
much of it belongs to history. But Miss Burney’s
<span class='it'>Diary</span> reveals the domestic details of the story as it
is not recorded in the periods of the politician, or in
the professional evidence of the doctors She depicts
the wearing suspense of the household, the confusion
and clash of conjectures, the grief and agony of the
Queen, the waiting rooms and passages filled with
silent pages and attendants, the thick, depressing
November fog, the hoarse voice of the King, talking,
talking, talking incessantly,—but still breathing
nothing but consideration for those about him.<a id='r66'/><a href='#f66' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[66]</span></sup></a> Then
comes, by order of the physicians, to whom a third
has now been added, the separation of the wife and
husband. This was on the 6th. On the morning of
the next day Miss Burney hears the Prince of Wales
tell the Queen what had happened the night before.
The King had got up, and insisted upon going into the
next room, which to his amazement, he found crowded
with members of the household ranged in dead silence
around it on chairs and sofas. He inquired what
they did there, spoke fondly of his favourite son, the
Duke of York (then present, but not seen) and finally
penned Sir George Baker [the Queen’s physician] into
a corner, calling him an old woman, who did not
understand his complaint, which was only nervous.
During all this, no one dared approach him. At last
Colonel Digby (who, in his own family, had some
experience of demented persons) took him by the arm,
and begged him to go back to bed. The King refused,
<span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span>
and asked him who he was. “I am Colonel Digby,
Sir”—he answered—“and your Majesty has been very
good to me often, and now I am going to be very good
to you, for you must come to bed, Sir, it is necessary
to your life.” The King was so surprised that he let
himself be drawn away like a child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the fortnight that followed, things passed from
bad to worse for the dwellers in the Upper Lodge.
To add to the general disquiet and apprehension,
Mrs. Schwellenberg arrived from Weymouth “all
spasm and horror.” Then, by order of the Prince of
Wales, intercourse with the outer world was practically
suspended. As the King’s condition did not alter, the
physicians told Mr. Pitt plainly that his ailment was
lunacy; and on the 28th it was decided that he should
be transferred to Kew, a place he detested, but where
it was possible for him to take exercise without observation.
Accordingly, on that day, the Queen and
Princesses made precipitate and miserable exodus to
Kew, amid the tears of the sorrowing household,—even
the sentinels crying bitterly as they looked on.
Then came the difficult task of persuading the King to
follow, which he eventually did, being induced thereto
by the promise that he should see the Queen,—a
promise which was not kept, with the result that the
night which ensued was one of the most violently bad
of any yet passed. And so, “in all its dark colours,
dark as its darkest prognostics,” began the “Kew
campaign” from which, as usual, Mrs. Schwellenberg
was not absent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To recapitulate the discomforts of the cold and
carpetless building at Kew, never intended for a
winter residence, and lacking sadly both in space and
<span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span>
accommodation, is here needless. But, notwithstanding
Miss Burney’s “darkest prognostics,” a brighter
day was happily dawning. New doctors were added to
the old; and the new were better. Dr. Francis Willis
and his son, both of whom had special experience in
mental disease, henceforth, and much to the satisfaction
of the household, took practical charge of the case.
Honest, open, cheerful and high-minded, their moral
influence over their patient, in combination with a
gentler and more humane method of treatment, was
not slow to produce its effect. The King began to
walk regularly in the gardens; and hopes of his
recovery fitfully revived. But while his health vacillated,
the world outside was agitating for a Regency.
The Willises—of whom there were now three—persevered
no less with their regimen. And so,—omitting
many immaterial things,—we come to the
2nd February, a day memorable in Fanny’s annals.
For the sake of her health, she had been advised to
walk daily either at Richmond or at Kew, according
to the report she received of the King’s whereabouts.
On this particular day, she had been told that His
Majesty would walk in Richmond Park, and she
therefore directed her steps to Kew Gardens. It
had been arranged that if, on any occasion, the King
chanced to see her, she was to be allowed to run off.
By some misapprehension, he <span class='it'>was</span> in the Gardens, and
at once detected her presence. What was worse, she
soon heard him hurrying after her, calling hoarsely
“Miss Burney! Miss Burney!” Terrified beyond
measure, she continued to run until she was peremptorily
bidden to stop by the Willises, as His Majesty
was doing himself harm. “When they were within
<span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span>
a few yards of me,” she writes, “the King called out,
‘Why did you run away?’ ” Making a violent effort
to regain her composure, she turned to meet him,
when to her astonishment, the poor invalid, with “all
his wonted benignity,” despite the wildness still in his
eyes, put both his hands round her shoulders, and
kissed her on the cheek, going on to exhibit such
delight at seeing her again, that she straightway
lost all her fear. A long, disconnected conversation
ensued. He rallied her about Mrs. Schwellenberg.
She was not to mind: he (King George) was her
friend. He talked about the pages; about her father;
about Handel, some passages of whose Oratorios he
tried to sing—hoarsely. He spoke also, with tears
in his eyes, of Mrs. Delany. At length, after repeated
injunctions on the part of his medical attendants, he
let her go—his last words being to reassure her upon
the subject of Mrs. Schwellenberg. All this—some of
the Schwellenberg part excepted—Fanny recounted
faithfully to the Queen on her return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not long after, the King’s state began to amend,
greatly to the dismay of the advocates of the Regency
Bill. Before that measure could be read a third
time, he was almost himself again; and at the end of
February was able personally to assure Miss Burney
of his convalescent condition. She found him in the
Queen’s dressing room, where he had waited on
purpose to see her. “I am quite well now”—he
said; “I was nearly so when I saw you before—but
I could overtake you better now.” Ten days later,
at the time of the general rejoicing, when the Queen
had had a special transparency painted for Kew Palace
by her favourite Biagio Rebecca, the little Princess
<span class='pageno' title='169' id='Page_169'></span>
Amelia led her father to the front window to see
the illuminations, dropping first upon her knees with
a copy of congratulatory verses, which had been
expressly composed for the occasion by the Junior
Keeper of Robes. Miss Burney was as “ill at these
numbers” as most manufacturers of metrical loyalty;
but her postscript</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<div class='literal-container' style=''><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“The little bearer begs a kiss</p>
<p class='line0'>From dear Papa, for bringing this”—</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>was naturally not spoken in vain. On the next day
the King, reinstated in all his dignities, received, in
person, the Address of the Lords and Commons upon
his restoration to health.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over the further progress of that restoration we
may pass rapidly. By this date, March 11th, 1789,
Miss Burney had been more than two years and a
half in the Queen’s service, and her stay was to be
prolonged for two years more. But it is needless to
pursue its story with equal detail. After the Royal
Family quitted Kew, they went to Weymouth, their
progress to that watering-place being one continued
scene of loyal and very genuine rejoicing. At Weymouth,
where they were domiciled in Gloucester
House, Miss Burney renewed her acquaintance with
Mrs. Siddons, whom she saw as Rosalind, but considered
“too large for that shepherd’s dress,” and as
Lady Townly in the <span class='it'>Provoked Husband</span> which she had
read at Windsor. Fanny thought her gaiety was
only gravity disguised, and though she praises her
as Cibber’s heroine, evidently preferred the “great
Sarah” of the Georgian Era in tragedy. She also,
and for the first time, beheld Mr. Pitt; but did not
<span class='pageno' title='170' id='Page_170'></span>
admire his appearance, which she affirms was neither
noble nor expressive. She spent much of her time
with the beautiful “Jessamy Bride,” Mrs. Gwyn; and
among other places, visited the Plymouth Dockyard,
describing the forging of an anchor there with something
of that later fine writing which was so effectually
to ruin her style. “While we were seeing the anchor
business, which seemed performed by Vulcanic demons,
so black they looked, so savage was their howl in
striking the red-hot iron, and so coarse and slight
their attire”—is quite in the perverse manner of the
coming <span class='it'>Memoirs of Dr. Burney</span>. In returning from
Weymouth, the Royal party stopped at Longleat,
which gives her an opportunity of moralising,—in
Bishop Ken’s bed-room,—upon the cruelty of Longleat’s
former tenant, “Granville the polite,” in forcing her
old friend Mrs. Delany, to marry <span class='it'>en premières noces</span>,
that extremely undesirable suitor, Mr. Pendarves of
Roscrow. And so, by Tottenham Park, where the
Earl of Aylesbury had put up a new bed for the King
and Queen which cost him £900, they got back to
Windsor in September. By this time the King had
completely lost all traces of his indisposition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once again at Windsor, the Court sank back into
its old jog-trot tedium, and with it sank Fanny’s
heart. There was now no Mrs. Delany to sympathise
when Schwellenbergism reached a more acute stage
than usual; and there was shortly to be no Colonel
Digby with whom to deplore the vicissitudes of a vale
of tears, or to discuss, “in his genteel roundabout
way,” the improving <span class='it'>Night Thoughts</span> of Dr. Young.
Colonel Digby, who, from time to time, had renewed
at Windsor the old readings, tea-drinkings, and semi-confidential
<span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span>
conversations, had not taken a very prominent
part in the Weymouth expedition. But he had
apparently been permitting himself other distractions;
and about November his connection with the Court
was interrupted by his approaching marriage to
Miss Gunning, with whom—and even by the King
during his insanity—his name, as we have said, had
already been associated. There is no doubt that
Miss Burney had been impressed by him, if only
as the most refined and amiable of her colleagues;
and there can also be no doubt that on his part he
must have found her sympathy and companionship
especially grateful in his newly bereaved condition.
However this may be—and Miss Burney could not
have behaved better if she had been Cecilia herself—this
last event manifestly added its quota to the
growing burden of her life; and it was not in her
nature to conceal her discomforts, either mental or
physical. Her health declined visibly; the Schwellenberg
card-table grew more wearisome than ever; and
her condition began to cause anxiety to her friends.
At last she took advantage of an accident to speak
frankly to her father. She told him plainly that,
kind and considerate as were the King and Queen,
the situation had grown insupportable; and that
she “could never, in any part of the live-long day,
command liberty, or social intercourse, or repose.”<a id='r67'/><a href='#f67' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[67]</span></sup></a>
<span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span>
Dr. Burney himself had for some time not been wholly
happy about her position; and he of course opened
his arms to her return. But he was not rich,
and he was manifestly so much upset at the thought
of her retirement that, for the moment, the matter
was allowed to drop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the months once more rolled on monotonously.
To divert her thoughts, she took up a
tragedy which she had begun during the King’s
illness; and the rumour that she had again her pen
in hand—upon a satirical novel, as it was supposed—sent
a flutter of apprehension through the Windsor
dove-cotes. Her friends continued to carry dismal
accounts to London of her failing condition, and
loudly exclaimed against Dr. Burney’s irresolution.
Walpole asked whether her talents were given to
be buried in obscurity. Windham, whom she saw
occasionally during the further dilatory progress of
the Hastings trial, threatened to set the Literary
Club on her father, who was a member of that community.
Busybody Boswell—another member—also
interested himself (not perhaps without ulterior views
of his own as regards her Johnson material) in her
behalf. “We shall address Dr. Burney in a body,”
he said; and then he asked her to give him some of
Dr. Johnson’s “choice little notes,”—a request she
with difficulty evaded. At last a joint Memorial was
drawn up by Dr. Burney and his daughter, praying
that she might be permitted to resign, and it was
arranged to put it forward on the most favourable
<span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span>
opportunity. But the opportunity did not arise, and
still time went on. She grew worse, having constantly,
in the course of the obnoxious card parties, to
crawl to her room for hartshorn and a few moments
of rest. By and by the presentation of the memorial
grew imperative. To the horror of Mrs. Schwellenberg,
for whom such a proceeding was sheer self-destruction,
it was hesitatingly handed in. The
Queen, to whom it is difficult to believe that the
matter was wholly unexpected, was visibly surprised
and disturbed. She, however, expressed the hope that
a long holiday might set Miss Burney right. But with
this Miss Burney’s father—now thoroughly alive to
the exigencies of the case,—could not agree; and to
Her Majesty’s disappointment, and the unconcealed
disgust of Mrs. Schwellenberg, it was decided she
must go. When her departure was definitely settled,
a Martin’s summer seems to have followed, in which
even “Cerbera” softened somewhat—admitting, in
her favourite phrase, that “The Bernan bin reely
agribble.” Fanny had a short illness, which helped
to strengthen her case; and then, in July, 1791, five
years after she had entered the Upper Lodge, she
quitted the Court for ever, being too much affected to
bid her royal Master a final farewell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Much ink has been expended on that portion of
Fanny Burney’s career which forms the subject of this
chapter. Exceptionally clever and gifted she was,
without doubt; but with all her abilities, it must be
admitted that, neither by her antecedents nor her
experiences, was she suited for the post she was
called upon to fill. The merely mechanical part
of it she might perhaps have acquired,—though it
<span class='pageno' title='174' id='Page_174'></span>
seems she never did. Etiquette and formality she
heartily detested; she was unmethodical; she was negligent
in her dress; she was not always (in the presentation
of petitions and the like) entirely judicious and
tactful. Nevertheless, there is nothing to show that,
save for the death of Mrs. Delany, the terrible tension
of the King’s illness, the defection of Colonel Digby,
and, above all, the unrelieved infliction of Mrs. Schwellenberg’s
company and caprices,—the “one flaw” in her
lot, she calls it,—she might not gradually have grown
reconciled to her court life. If she were not (and it
was no shame to her!) as good a Queen’s Dresser as
Mrs. Haggerdorn, she was certainly—although, perhaps
from her weak voice and short sight, she practically
failed as a reader—an infinitely better “Confidential
Companion.” The “Oyster” would have been utterly
incompetent to report the Hastings trial, or to scribble
a royal copy of verses to the Master of the Horse, or to
delight the Queen by a circumstantial and picturesque
account of the interview with the King in the gardens
at Kew. And whatever Miss Burney’s dislike may have
been to one or two of her colleagues, her own personal
good qualities and intellectual capacity were always
cordially recognised by all the Royal Family.<a id='r68'/><a href='#f68' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[68]</span></sup></a> As
to the enforced suspension of her literary labours, not
only is that a grievance which she herself never felt
or advanced; but when she came to Windsor in 1786,
she had absolutely written nothing for four years.
Nor were there any indications that she was likely
to write anything. Her most stimulating friend and
<span class='pageno' title='175' id='Page_175'></span>
critic, “Daddy” Crisp, was dead; and she professed,
or affected to profess (like a greater writer after <span class='it'>The
Newcomes</span>),<a id='r69'/><a href='#f69' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[69]</span></sup></a> that her vein had run dry with her latest
book. Moreover, we now know what her first critics
did not know, namely, that so far from receiving two
thousand pounds for <span class='it'>Cecilia</span>, she had only—after more
than a year’s hard work—received two hundred and
fifty pounds. The deserts of genius are not easily
assessed; but looking to all the circumstances, those
who, in this particular instance, regarded two hundred
a year for life, with accommodation and other advantages,
as an offer worth considering by a diffident and
delicate woman of four and thirty, whose entire gains
by two popular novels, making eight volumes, had
not exceeded two hundred and eighty pounds—can
scarcely be said to have been wholly unwise in their
generation. That there would be compensating drawbacks
of tedium and restraint, they no doubt expected;
but that the accidents of the employment would make
the post untenable, was a result they could not possibly
foresee.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER VII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>HALF A LIFETIME</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'>Whatever view may be taken of the effect of Miss
Burney’s life at Court upon her literary prospects, it
was allowed by King George that she had sacrificed
something. “It is but her due,” said that amiable
monarch, referring to the Queen’s intention of granting
her late Keeper of Robes a retiring allowance. “She
has given up five years of her pen.” A hundred pounds
per annum may not, it is true, seem much; but considering
the amount of Miss Burney’s salary, and the brief
duration of her service, it was not illiberal. And it
came out of the Queen’s pocket. “It is solely from <span class='it'>me</span>
to <span class='it'>you</span>,”—Her Majesty told her, adding other friendly
expressions of farewell. This pension, or retiring
allowance,—as far as we know,—Miss Burney continued
to receive for the greater part of her life, which
lasted forty-eight years more. That this is also the
period comprised in the present chapter, may appear—at
first sight—to suggest a certain hurry at the close.
But the fault lies with the material, not with the limits
of the volume. After Miss Burney’s resignation, and
her marriage two years later, the events of her career,
as well as the record of them, grow less interesting.
She wrote tragedies, one of which was produced, and
<span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span>
failed. She wrote a comedy, which was never produced
at all. She wrote—mainly for money—two
novels, which were commercial successes but added
nothing to her reputation. Finally, in extreme old
age, she wrote <span class='it'>Memoirs</span> of her father, which have
been over-abused, but which cannot conscientiously
be praised. Such are the leading facts of her literary
life from the 7th July, 1791,—the day she quitted
St. James’s Palace,—to her death in 1840.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a week or two she remained at home,—home
being now Chelsea College, where her father was
domiciled. Then her kind friend, Mrs. Ord, carried her
off on a four months’ tour to recruit. “She rambled”—in
Macaulay’s picturesque phrases—“by easy journeys
from cathedral to cathedral, and from watering-place
to watering-place. She crossed the New Forest, and
visited Stonehenge and Wilton, the cliffs of Lyme, and
the beautiful valley of Sidmouth. Thence she journeyed
by Powderham Castle, and by the ruins of
Glastonbury Abbey, to Bath, and from Bath, when
the winter was approaching, returned well and cheerful
to London.”<a id='r70'/><a href='#f70' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[70]</span></sup></a> By this time it was the middle of
October. Her father had anxiously awaited her
coming, not without hope that she would forthwith
resume her literary pursuits. Resume them indeed
she did, but fitfully, working chiefly at tragedies, two
of which she had roughly sketched at Windsor. To
these she now added a third. “I go on with various
writings,” she says at the close of 1791, “at different
times, and just as the humour strikes. I have promised
my dear father a Christmas Box, and a New Year’s
gift upon my return from Norbury Park, and therefore
<span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span>
he now kindly leaves me to my own devices.” But
social functions, as in the post-Cecilian days, began to
exercise their old attraction; and, in her <span class='it'>Diary</span>, we
frequently trace her at places which were not those
haunts of study and imagination, the great and little
“Grubberies” at Chelsea. She visits poor Sir Joshua,
now nearly blind, with bandaged and green-shaded
eyes, and fast nearing his end.<a id='r71'/><a href='#f71' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[71]</span></sup></a> “ ‘I am very glad,’
he said, in a meek voice and dejected accent, ‘to see
you again, and I wish I could see you better! but I
have only one eye now—and hardly that.’ ” She visits
Buckingham House periodically, and even looks in
upon “Cerbera,” who is unexpectedly cordial, though
she has evidently not forgiven her old colleague for
declining to die at her post. During the temporary
lameness of her successor, Mlle. Jacobi, Miss Burney
goes so far as to resume her attendance for two days,
only to be amply assured, by that brief experience, of
the peril she has escaped. “Indeed,”—she says,—“I was
half dead with only two days’ and nights’ exertion.”
She goes again to the ever-during Hastings trial,<a id='r72'/><a href='#f72' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[72]</span></sup></a>
renewing her relations with Windham; she goes to
a public breakfast at Mrs. Montagu’s in Portman
Square, and sees the Feather Room, referred to in
chapter iv. “It was like a full Ranelagh by daylight,”
she writes; and among other guests she meets
Sophy Streatfield, no longer the peerless “S.S.” of
yore, but faded, and sad, and changed. Another visit
she mentions is to Mrs. Crewe at Hampstead. Mrs.
Crewe, it will be remembered, was the daughter of
<span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span>
Fanny’s godmother, Mrs. Greville. Here she listens
to Burke’s praise of her dead friend, Mrs. Delany,
whom he affirms to have been “a real fine lady”—“the
model of an accomplished woman of former times”;
and she reads with her hostess the newly published
<span class='it'>Pleasures of Memory</span> of Mr. Samuel Rogers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The close of 1792 was saddened by the sudden death
of Miss Burney’s brother-in-law, Mr. Francis of Aylsham,—an
event which detained her for some time in Norfolk.
It is about this time, too, that we begin to hear
of the French refugees whose arrival in this country,
previous to the execution of Louis the Sixteenth, was
to exercise so important an influence upon Fanny’s
fortunes. The letters of Mrs. Phillips from Mickleham
are much occupied with these illustrious exiles. There
is the Duc de Liancourt, who has escaped to England
in a small boat covered with faggots; there is Mme.
de Broglie, who has taken a little cottage hard by in
the hamlet of West Humble. There is a group who
have clubbed to rent Juniper Hall—a delightful and
still existent house on the road between Mickleham
and Burford Bridge. This group, or syndicate, consists
of Count Louis de Narbonne, ex-Minister of War;
of the Marquise de la Châtre and her son; of M. de
Montmorency, “a <span class='it'>ci-devant Duc</span>”; of M. de Jaucourt;
and afterwards of Mme. de Staël, and M. Ch. Maurice
de Talleyrand-Périgord, late Bishop of Autun,—not yet
the terrible old man of Maclise’s sketch and Rossetti’s
scathing description,<a id='r73'/><a href='#f73' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[73]</span></sup></a> but a dignified personage of
eight-and-thirty. Finally there was M. de Narbonne’s
friend, M. Alexandre D’Arblay, an artillery officer,
<span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span>
<span class='it'>maréchal de camp</span> and former adjutant-general to La
Fayette. On the night of the flight to Varennes he
had been on guard at the Tuileries. With all these
pathetic figures of exile, the waif and stray of a fallen
Constitution, Mrs. Phillips, with her French traditions
and education, was delighted; but particularly with
the last. “He seems to me”—she writes to Fanny in
November—“a true <span class='it'>militaire, franc et loyal</span>—open as
the day—warmly affectionate to his friends—intelligent,
ready, and amusing in conversation, with a great
share of <span class='it'>gaieté de cœur</span>, and at the same time, of <span class='it'>naïveté</span>
and <span class='it'>bonne foi</span>.” Further, he was announced to be about
forty, tall, with a good figure, and a frank and manly
countenance. Like his friend, Narbonne, he had lost
almost everything, but what Narbonne had left they
were to share. “Quoique ce soit, nous le partagerons
ensemble,” he said. “Je ne m’en fais pas le moindre
scrupule, puisque nous n’avons eu qu’un intérêt commun,
et nous nous sommes toujours aimés comme
frères.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Early in January, having duly presented herself at
Buckingham House on the Queen’s Birthday, Fanny
set out for Norbury Park, arriving just after the news
of the execution of Louis the Sixteenth, an event
which of course overwhelmed her. With her quick
sympathies, she was soon absorbed by the interesting
tenants of <span class='it'>Junipère</span>, as they called it; and they, on
their side, were equally interested in the author of
<span class='it'>Cecilia</span>.<a id='r74'/><a href='#f74' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[74]</span></sup></a> Mme. de Staël, who was now at the head
of the little French colony, was especially amiable to
the lady whom she designates “la première femme
<span class='pageno' title='181' id='Page_181'></span>
d’Angleterre”; and Fanny seems to have been delighted
from the first with Narbonne and his friend.
M. D’Arblay—she tells her father—“is one of the
most delightful characters I have ever met, for openness,
probity, intellectual knowledge, and unhackneyed
manners.” Very soon she is being pressed by Mme. de
Staël—who is as ardent as Mrs. Thrale—to come and
stay at Juniper. Concurrently, M. D’Arblay, who, in
addition to his other good qualities, turns out to be
“passionately fond of literature, a most delicate critic
in his own language, well versed in both Italian and
German, and a very elegant poet,”<a id='r75'/><a href='#f75' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[75]</span></sup></a> undertakes to teach
her French in return for lessons in English. Dr.
Burney, who received these confidences (<span class='it'>per</span> favour of
M. de Talleyrand <span class='it'>en route</span> to his too expensive lodgings
in Woodstock Street), and no doubt recollected the
similar relations of Sir Charles Grandison and Clementina,
must have foreseen the result—not without
misgiving. He did not like Talleyrand; there was
gossip afloat about Narbonne and Mme. de Staël; and at
length, when “this enchanting M. D’Arblay” (as Fanny
calls him to Mrs. Locke) openly expressed what was
no doubt a genuine affection for his daughter, he was
naturally averse from a match which promised so little,
as the gentleman had no prospect of regaining his lost
fortune, and Fanny had only her pension and her pen.
But romance, and the world, were, as usual, against
common sense; and after retreating for a little “maiden
meditation” to Chessington, whither she was promptly
<span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span>
followed by her lover, Fanny was eventually married to
M. D’Arblay at Mickleham Church on the 31st July,
1793, Captain Burney, in the absence of his father,
giving her away. Owing to the bridegroom’s being a
Roman Catholic, the ceremony was, on the following day,
repeated at the chapel of the Sardinian Ambassador
in London—the object being that, if by any chance
M. D’Arblay came to his own again, his wife might
not be debarred from participation. Their means for
the present were limited to Fanny’s pension, which, it
had been feared, might be withdrawn. This fear,
however, must have been removed. Mr. Locke gave
them a site for a cottage in Norbury Park, adding
cheerfully that after all, £100 per annum was but the
income of many curates. But the view of the outsiders
is expressed by Miss Maria Josepha Holroyd
in a letter to her friend Miss Firth. “I must desire
you”—she writes—“to wonder at Miss Burney’s marriage
if I have not mentioned it before. She met with
Monsieur D’Arblay at Mr. Locke’s, therefore probably
Mme. de Staël was in the secret.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. “He [M.
D’Arblay] is even worse off than many other Emigrants,
who have at least a futurity of Order in France to look
forward to. But this man is disinherited by his father,
for the part he took in politics, having followed LaFayette
on his Étât Major. Miss Burney has nothing
but the 100l from the Queen. Should you not have
formed a better opinion of the author of <span class='it'>Cecilia</span>?”<a id='r76'/><a href='#f76' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[76]</span></sup></a>
<span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The match, not the less, was a thoroughly happy
one. “Never,”—says Mme. D’Arblay’s niece,—“never
was union more blessed and felicitous; though
after the first eight years of unmingled happiness, it
was assailed by many calamities, chiefly of separation
or illness, yet still mentally unbroken.” Pending the
arrival of funds for building the cottage in Norbury
Park, they went into temporary lodgings in Phenice
or Phœnix Farm, and subsequently migrated to what she
calls—“a very small house in the suburbs of a very
small village called Bookham”—about two miles from
Mickleham. Very early in his wedded life M. D’Arblay
announced his intention of taking part in the Toulon
Expedition; but fortunately for his wife, his services,
for reasons which do not appear, were not accepted by
the Government. Upon this he settled down quietly
to domesticity and gardening—in which he was apparently
more energetic than expert. “Abdolonime,”<a id='r77'/><a href='#f77' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[77]</span></sup></a>
writes Mme. D’Arblay to her father after his first visit
to the Bookham hermitage,—“ ‘Abdolonime’ [who
figures her husband] has no regret but that his garden
was not in better order; he was a little <span class='it'>piqué</span>, he confesses,
that you said it was not <span class='it'>very neat</span>—and, <span class='it'>to be
shor!</span>—but his passion is to do great works: he undertakes
with pleasure, pursues with energy, and finishes
with spirit, but, then, all is over! He thinks the
business once done always done; and to repair, and
amend, and weed, and cleanse,—O, these are drudgeries
insupportable to him!“ However, he seems to have
succeeded in “<span class='it'>plantant des choux</span>,” as it is admitted
that the Bookham cabbages were remarkable for freshness
<span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span>
and flavour; and when La Fayette’s ex-adjutant
mowed down the hedge with his sabre, his wife was
“the most <span class='it'>contente personne</span> in the world” to see that
warlike weapon so peaceably employed. Madame herself,
after composing a not very persuasive Address
to the Ladies of England on behalf of the Emigrant
French clergy, was plying her pen upon a new novel
and a tragedy. Then, at the close of 1794,—a year
which had not been “blemished with one regretful
moment,” her activities were interrupted by the birth
(Dec. 18) of a son, who was christened Alexandre
Charles Louis Piochard, his <span class='it'>prénoms</span> being derived from
his father, and his godfathers, Dr. Burney junior, and
the Count de Narbonne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tragedy was the earlier of Mme. D’Arblay’s new
works to see the light. She had begun it, she says, at
Kew, and she finished it at Windsor (August, 1790),
without any specific intention either of production or
publication. Having been read by some of her family
and friends, it was shown by her brother Charles to
John Kemble, who pronounced for its acceptance. A
few days before the birth of her son it was suddenly
required for Sheridan’s inspection, with the result that,
according to the author’s account, it was brought
out at Drury Lane without the full revision she intended,
and as she subsequently had a seven weeks’
illness, was never in a position, to give it. On the
21st March, 1795, it was played. But not even
the Kembles and Mrs. Siddons, aided as they were
by Bensley and Palmer, could secure a success for
<span class='it'>Edwy and Elgiva</span>, nor could the fact that there
were no fewer than three Bishops among the <span class='it'>dramatis
personae</span>, save it from being withdrawn, nominally “for
<span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span>
alterations,” after one solitary performance. Mme.
D’Arblay quite reasonably attributes some of its ill-fortune
to her inability to correct it and superintend
the rehearsals; and, in a later letter, which gives an
account of its fate, she lays stress upon the very
unsatisfactory acting of some of the subordinate
performers. But though <span class='it'>Edwy and Elgiva</span> was
never printed, the <span class='sc'>ms.</span>, which still exists, has been
carefully examined by a capable critic, whose report
leaves little room for doubt as to the real cause of its
faint reception.<a id='r78'/><a href='#f78' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[78]</span></sup></a> Though at some points there is a
certain stir and action, the plot generally lacks incident
and movement. But what is said to be fatal is the
“incurable poverty of its stilted language, its commonplace
sentiments, and its incorrect and inharmonious
versification.” The specimens given of the blank verse
are certainly of the most unhappy kind. From the
fact that the <span class='sc'>ms.</span> is carefully pencilled with amendments
in French and English, it is probable that, just
as “Daddy” Crisp had, to the last, believed in <span class='it'>Virginia</span>,
the author must have continued to believe in <span class='it'>Edwy and
Elgiva</span>. But though Cumberland—always forgiving
to a failure—professed that the players had lent it an
ill-name, and offered to risk his life on its success if it
were re-cast and submitted to his inspection, it is not
likely the audience were radically wrong. What is
wonderful is, that Sheridan and Kemble should have
accepted it, and that Mrs. Siddons should have consented
to play the heroine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When, a month after the production of <span class='it'>Edwy and
Elgiva</span>, Warren Hastings, to Mme. D’Arblay’s great
<span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span>
delight, was finally acquitted, she was apparently hard
at work upon her new novel, with which she makes as
rapid progress as is consistent with the absorbing
care of the little personage whom she styles the
“Bambino,” and to whom she hopes “it may be a little
portion.” In June she tells a friend that it has been a
long time in hand, and will be published in about a
year. But, owing to the expenses of the press, she has
now—money being a very definite object—decided to
act upon the advice, formerly given to her by Burke,
and to print by subscription. “This is in many—many
ways,” she writes, “unpleasant and unpalatable
to us both; but the chance of real use and benefit to
our little darling overcomes all scruples, and, therefore,
to work we go.” The Honble. Mrs. Boscawen, Mrs.
Crewe and Mrs. Locke consented to keep the subscription
books. The result of this contrivance, which Dr.
Burney (who was generally unfortunate as an adviser)
did not at first approve, was a complete pecuniary
success. <span class='it'>Camilla; or, a Picture of Youth</span>, was issued in
the middle of 1796, in five volumes, 8vo., with a list of
subscribers rivalling that of Prior to the poems of
1718. It occupies thirty-eight pages; and the whole
is headed by the Duchess of York, and the Duke of
Gloucester. The volumes are dedicated, from Bookham,
to the Queen, who, when they were presented to
her at Windsor by Mme. D’Arblay and her husband
in person, repaid the compliment by a purse of one
hundred guineas from herself and the King. Many
persons took more than one copy. Warren Hastings
interested himself specially for his staunch adherent,
and engaged to attack the East Indies on her behalf.
Burke, a sad and mourning man, who had lost both
<span class='pageno' title='187' id='Page_187'></span>
son and brother, subscribed nevertheless for them,
as well as for his wife, sending £20 for a single
copy; three of the Miss Thrales took ten copies,
Mrs. Piozzi two, and so forth. It would be idle to
select further names; but two are of special interest.
One is that of “Miss J. Austen, Steventon”; the other
that of the sworn adversary of “what you call stuff,”
Mrs. Schwellenberg, who with Miss Planta and Miss
Goldsworthy rallied round an old colleague. The
names of Colonel Digby and his wife are significantly
absent.<a id='r79'/><a href='#f79' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[79]</span></sup></a> The result of all this effort was encouraging.
About a month after publication Dr. Burney told
Horace Walpole that his daughter had made £2000;
and three months after publication only five hundred
copies remained out of four thousand. The selling
price was one guinea, so that Macaulay’s estimate
that the author “cleared more than three thousand
guineas” is,—allowing for fancy payments and the
Queen’s <span class='it'>douceur</span>, and deducting for the cost of publication,—probably
below the mark upon this occasion.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Camilla</span>, however, could not be called a literary success,
even by its contemporaries, and certainly was not
an advance upon the writer’s previous works. Horace
Walpole, who had regretted the live-burial of the
author’s talents in the Windsor antechambers, was
too frank to disguise his disappointment. He had not
cared for <span class='it'>Cecilia</span> as much as <span class='it'>Evelina</span>: he thought the
<span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span>
“deplorable <span class='it'>Camilla</span>” infinitely worse than <span class='it'>Cecilia</span>.
“Madame D’Arblay,”—he wrote to Hannah More in
August, 1796,—had “reversed experience.” She had
known the world and penetrated character before she
had stepped over the threshold, “and, now she had
seen so much of it, she had little or no insight at all.”
This, of course, did not prevent the <span class='it'>Monthly Review</span>
from politely comparing her to Homer,—both for
occasionally nodding and for the peculiar distinctness
and propriety of her delineations of character. But
though Mme. D’Arblay still deserves the praise which
Burke had formerly given to her, and which the <span class='it'>Monthly
Review</span> repeats, of assigning “to each person a language
of his own, and preserving it uniformly through the
work,” the maze of misapprehensions which encompass
the loves of Camilla Tyrold and Edgar Mandlebert grows
sadly tedious, and the book, it must be confessed, is
difficult reading. Whether, if it had been written in
the style of <span class='it'>Evelina</span>, it would have been more attractive,
is impossible to say: the style in which it is in
great part written, by reason of its absurd roundabout
pomposity, is simply unendurable. “Where opinion
may humour systematic prepossession, who shall build
upon his virtue or wisdom to guard the transparency
of his impartiality”—is one of the sentences which
even Mr. Griffiths’ review is forced to characterise
as “singularly obscure.” Obscure it certainly is; but
it is not by any means single, for there are other
passages to pattern. For this extraordinary degradation
of manner various reasons have been assigned.
It has been ascribed to recollections of Johnson,—to
imitation of Dr. Burney,—to the influence of a French
husband,—to the inflation superinduced upon a court
<span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span>
appointment. There is another cause that has not
been mentioned, which we suspect had more to do with
the matter than any of the things suggested. This
is, that Mme. D’Arblay had recently been engaged in
the composing of much indifferent blank verse; and
like other distinguished authors, she fell insensibly
into this laboured style whenever she had anything
to say in her own person which she regarded as
unusually fine. And it is curious that the manner
must have been adopted <span class='it'>de parti pris</span>, for, as the
“Abdolonime” quotation on an earlier page almost
suffices to show, she was, at this very time, writing
easy and graphic letters to her friends. But apart
from the style, and the fact that the personages reproduce,
in many instances, the earlier types, there
is still humour and careful character-drawing in the
Orkbornes and Dubsters and Clarendels of <span class='it'>Camilla</span>.
And even the impatient modern may care to remember
that in Chapter V. of <span class='it'>Northanger Abbey</span> Jane Austen
does not scruple to couple it with <span class='it'>Cecilia</span> and Miss
Edgeworth’s <span class='it'>Belinda</span> in terms of enthusiastic praise;
and that Charles Lamb himself, in a sonnet to Fanny’s
novelist step-sister Sarah Harriet, referring to her
elder as—</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span>
At the close of 1796 Mme. D’Arblay lost her step-mother.
By this time she was apparently engaged in
converting the gains from <span class='it'>Camilla</span> into bricks and
mortar. Upon a piece of land in a field at West
Humble, leased to her husband by Mr. Locke of
Norbury,<a id='r81'/><a href='#f81' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[81]</span></sup></a> they built a cottage, to which, at Dr.
Burney’s suggestion, they gave the name of the novel;<a id='r82'/><a href='#f82' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[82]</span></sup></a>
and the letters at this date are full of the activities of
M. D’Arblay, who was his own sole architect and
surveyor, in planning his new garden, digging a well,
and constructing a sunk fence to prevent the inroads
of the domestic (and prospective) cow. As may be
anticipated, the cost of building largely exceeded
the estimate. “Our new habitation”—she writes in
August, 1797—“will very considerably indeed exceed
our first intentions and expectations”; and not much
remained when the bills for Camilla Cottage were
discharged. The expenses of living in war time, too,
were exceptionally heavy, and various expedients were
<span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span>
suggested to replenish the <span class='it'>pot-au-feu</span>, including the
liberal planting of potatoes in every corner of the little
property. It was perhaps wise that under this pressure
Mme. D’Arblay did not fall in with Mrs. Crewe’s
proposal that she should edit an Anti-Jacobin journal
to be styled <span class='it'>The Breakfast Table</span>. But she again
attempted the stage with a comedy called <span class='it'>Love and
Fashion</span>, which, in 1799, was actually accepted and
put into rehearsal by Harris of Covent Carden. Dr.
Burney, however, had set his heart upon fiction. It
was in vain that his daughter protested that all her
life she had been urged to write a comedy, and that
to write a comedy was her ambition. Moreover, that
the incidents and effects for a drama occurred to her,
and the combinations for a long work did not. Her
father was seized with a panic of failure, and early in
1800 <span class='it'>Love and Fashion</span> was hastily withdrawn. Before
this took place, Mme. D’Arblay had the misfortune to
lose her sister, Mrs. Phillips, who since 1796 had been
resident in Ireland. She died on the 6th January,
when on her way to visit her relations. In 1801, the
preliminaries for the short-lived Peace of Amiens
having been signed, and the difficulties of the domestic
situation being urgent, M. D’Arblay decided to return
to France, hoping vaguely, first, to recover his lost
property, and, secondly, to obtain from Napoleon
something in the nature of a recognition of his past
military services. Ultimately, having stipulated that
he should not be called upon to serve against his wife’s
country, and having besides pledged himself to the
Alien office, when obtaining his passport, not to return
to that country for a year, he found himself in the
double predicament of getting nothing, and being
<span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span>
obliged to remain in France, whither he accordingly
summoned his <span class='it'>bonne amie</span> and his son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mme. D’Arblay expected to have been able to come
back to her father in eighteen months: she stayed in
France ten years. During this period she resided with
her husband at Passy. Their means, in the absence of
remittances from England, which had practically ceased
with the renewal of the war, consisted, primarily, of a
small military <span class='it'>retraite</span>, or retiring allowance, of 1500
francs per annum (£62, 10s.), and later of a modest
income earned by M. D’Arblay as a <span class='it'>rédacteur</span> and afterwards
<span class='it'>sous-chef</span> in the Civil Department of <span class='it'>les Bâtiments</span>
(<span class='it'>Ministère de l’Intérieur</span>). The post was no sinecure,
and carried him to Paris daily from about half-past
eight to half-past five. But he was treated by his
chiefs with exemplary good feeling and consideration;
and although, for lack of funds, only three rooms
of the little home in the Rue Basse were finished
and furnished, the husband and wife were perfectly
happy. “Our view is extremely pretty from it [Paris
on one side; the country on the other], and always
cheerful; we rarely go out, yet always are pleased
to return. We have our books, our prate, and our
boy—how, with all this, can we, or ought we, to
suffer ourselves to complain of our narrowed and
narrowing income?” This was written in April, 1804.
In 1810, they have apparently moved to Paris, for she
dates from the Rue D’Anjou; and is rejoicing over the
adopted friends she has found in her adopted country.
“The society in which I mix, when I can prevail with
myself to quit my yet dearer fireside, is all that can be
wished, whether for wit, wisdom, intelligence, gaiety
or politeness.” M. D’Arblay, says the same letter, is
<span class='pageno' title='193' id='Page_193'></span>
well, and at his office, where he is sadly overworked;
and their son, now a youth of fifteen, with mathematical
gifts, is preparing, at the same table, an exercise for
his master. He is thin, pale and strong—we are
told elsewhere;—but terribly <span class='it'>sauvage</span>, and singularly
“averse to all the forms of society. Where he can
have got such a rebel humour we conceive not; but
it costs him more to make a bow than to resolve six
difficult problems of algebra, or to repeat twelve pages
from Euripides; and as to making a civil speech, he
would sooner renounce the world.”<a id='r83'/><a href='#f83' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[83]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1810 M. D’Arblay yielded to his wife’s desire to
visit her friends in England. Everything had been
done, and M. de Narbonne had procured her passport
from the terrible Fouché, when a sudden embargo
blocked all departures from the coast, and she was
unable to start. In the following year she was
operated upon for “a menace of cancer” by Napoleon’s
famous surgeon, Baron de Larrey, a trial which,
according to her niece, she bore with such fortitude as
to earn, in her French circle, the name of <span class='it'>L’Ange</span>. In
1812 she made another, and a more successful, attempt
to reach England. The necessity was then growing
urgent, as her son was seventeen, and liable soon to a
conscription which would have forced him to do the
very thing his father had endeavoured to avoid,—namely,
to fight the English. Mme. D’Arblay and
young Alexandre, after waiting six weeks vainly at
<span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span>
Dunkirk, at last landed at Deal in August. Many
things had happened in her ten years’ absence. The
King was now hopelessly mad; the Princess Amelia
was dead; Mr. Twining was dead, as was also Mr.
Locke of Norbury. She found her father sadly aged
and broken, and indeed almost entirely confined to his
bed-room. But she had plenty to occupy her during
her stay. First, there was the settling of her son at
Cambridge, where, having gained the Tancred scholarship,
he began residence at Christ’s College in
October 1813. Then there was the completion and
publication of a new book, of which nearly three
volumes out of five had been finished before she
quitted France. Already, from Paris, she had been
attempting some informal negotiations as to this, for
Byron had heard of its existence. “My bookseller,
Cawthorne,”—he wrote to Harness in Dec. 1811,—“has
just left me, and tells me, with a most important
face, that he is in treaty for a novel of Madame
D’Arblay’s, for which 1000 guineas are asked! He
wants me to read the MS. (if he obtains it), which I
shall do with pleasure; but I should be very cautious
in venturing an opinion on her whose <span class='it'>Cecilia</span> Dr.
Johnson superintended.<a id='r84'/><a href='#f84' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[84]</span></sup></a> If he lends it to me, I shall
put it into the hands of Rogers and M[oor]e, who are
truly men of taste.” Three days later, he repeats the
story to Hodgson; but the amount has grown to
1500 guineas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The best one can say about <span class='it'>The Wanderer; or,</span>
<span class='pageno' title='195' id='Page_195'></span>
<span class='it'>Female Difficulties</span>, issued in March 1814, is, that it
brought grist to the mill. It was not published by
subscription like <span class='it'>Camilla</span>;<a id='r85'/><a href='#f85' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[85]</span></sup></a> but Mme. D’Arblay herself
tells us that 3600 copies were “positively sold and
paid for” at the “rapacious price” of two guineas each
in six months. From a literary point of view the
book was an utter failure. It “was apparently never
read by anybody,” observes Sir Leslie Stephen; and
Macaulay says that “no judicious friend to the author’s
memory will attempt to draw it from the oblivion into
which it has justly fallen.” Even Mme. D’Arblay’s
most faithful editor and admirer, Mrs. Ellis, makes
open and heartfelt thanksgiving that it is not her
duty to read it again. After these discouraging
opinions from critics not unfriendly, it is scarcely surprising
to learn that <span class='it'>The Wanderer</span> was attacked with
unusual severity in the <span class='it'>Quarterly</span> for April, 1814; or
that Hazlitt should, in the <span class='it'>Edinburgh</span> for February,
1815, make it the sorry pretext for that admirable
survey of the national fiction which he afterwards
converted into No. <span class='sc'>vi.</span> of his <span class='it'>Lectures on the English
Comic Writers</span>. Hazlitt earned, as has already been told
in chapter i., the disapprobation of honest James Burney
for his treatment of Mme. D’Arblay’s final effort.
Yet it is notable that the critic blames <span class='it'>The Wanderer</span>,
not for “decay of talent, but a perversion of it.” It
is impossible to say as much now. The book, in truth,
is wearisome, and its “difficulties” are unreal. The
reason for its first success is, we suspect, to be traced to
the cause suggested by Mme. D’Arblay herself, namely,
<span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span>
the prevailing expectation that its pages would present
a picture of contemporary and revolutionary France,
where, it was known, the writer had been residing;
and that this led to a number of copies being freely
bespoken. When the real nature of its theme—the
trivial and improbable adventures, in England, of a
female refugee during the reign of Robespierre—was
fully appreciated, the sale immediately fell
off. Were it not futile, it would be interesting to
speculate whether, had <span class='it'>The Wanderer</span> taken the place
of <span class='it'>Evelina</span> in the order of Mme. D’Arblay’s productions,
it would have succeeded at all, even in the absence of
rivals. But it is a curious instance of the irony of
circumstance that a book which nobody could read
should have brought more than £7000 to somebody in
the year in which Miss Edgeworth published <span class='it'>Patronage</span>,
and Miss Austen, <span class='it'>Mansfield Park</span>. It is also more
curious still, that in this very year Constable could
not see his way to risk more than £700 on the copyright
of an anonymous novel entitled <span class='it'>Waverley; or, ’tis
Sixty Years Since</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Preface or Dedication to <span class='it'>The Wanderer</span>, from
which some quotations have already been made during
the progress of this volume, is dated 14 March, 1814.
On the 12 April following, Dr. Burney died, being
nursed tenderly by his daughter Fanny during his last
illness. He had attained his eighty-eighth year, and
since 1806 had enjoyed a pension of £300 per annum.
One of the last distinctions of his busy career, which
he had latterly occupied with a <span class='it'>Life of Metastasio</span> and
contributions to Rees’ <span class='it'>Cyclopædia</span>, was that of Correspondent
to the Institute of France, the diploma
for which Mme. D’Arblay brought with her from
<span class='pageno' title='197' id='Page_197'></span>
Paris. A tablet was erected to his memory in
Westminster Abbey. Not long after his death, his
daughter had the honour of being presented, in England,
to Louis <span class='sc'>xviii.</span>, who received her effusively,
complimenting her, “in very pretty English,” upon
her writings, and bidding her farewell at last under
the style of “Madame la Comtesse.”<a id='r86'/><a href='#f86' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[86]</span></sup></a> This was in
April, 1814, after the taking of Paris, and the
abdication of Buonaparte. A short time subsequently
M. D’Arblay arrived from the French capital. He
received a commission from the Duc de Luxembourg
as Sous-Lieutenant in the Corps de Garde, and was
restored to his old rank as Maréchal de Camp. He
came to England on leave later in the same year, and
took his wife back with him to France. Then followed
the return of Buonaparte from Elba; and in March,
1815, Mme. D’Arblay took flight for Brussels. Some
time afterwards she wrote from memory a narrative
of the Hundred Days (March 20 to June 28), which
has interest, but not the interest of a journal, although
it is supposed to have supplied Thackeray with hints
for the Brussels chapters of <span class='it'>Vanity Fair</span>. In July of
the same year, General D’Arblay, while attempting,
at Trèves, to raise a troop of refugees, received a kick
<span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span>
from an unbroken horse. The accident was made
worse by unskilled surgery; and having now, like his
wife, passed his sixtieth year, he was placed on the
retired list, with the title of Lieutenant-General, and
received permission to settle in England. Three years
later (3 May, 1818), he died at Bath, being buried in
Walcot churchyard.<a id='r87'/><a href='#f87' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[87]</span></sup></a> General D’Arblay is one of the
most delightful figures in his wife’s <span class='it'>Diary</span>. A true
<span class='it'>militaire</span>—as Susan Burney called him—he is also a
typical specimen of the old pre-revolutionary <span class='it'>régime</span>,
courteous, cheerful, amiable, and as dignified in ill-fortune
as he is patient under poverty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The remaining occurrences of Mme. D’Arblay’s life
may be rapidly related. At Bath, in 1817 she had
renewed her acquaintance with Mrs. Piozzi. At Ilfracombe,
in the same year, she had a narrow escape from
drowning, being surprised by the rising of the tide
when she was searching for curiosities. After M.
D’Arblay’s death she moved to 11, Bolton Street,
Piccadilly, which bears a Society of Arts tablet in
testimony of her residence there. It was at Bolton
Street that she was visited by Sir Walter Scott, who
describes her in his <span class='it'>Journal</span> for Nov. 18, 1826.
Rogers took him. He found her an elderly lady (she
was then seventy-four), “with no remains of personal
beauty, but with a gentle manner and a pleasing
expression of countenance. She told me she had
wished to see two persons—myself, of course, being
one; the other, George Canning. This was really a
compliment to be pleased with—a nice little handsome
pat of butter made up by a neat-handed Phillis of a
<span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span>
dairymaid, instead of the grease, fit only for cart-wheels,
which one is dosed with by the pound.” She
told him the story of <span class='it'>Evelina</span>, and the mulberry tree
episode.<a id='r88'/><a href='#f88' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[88]</span></sup></a> “I trust I shall see this lady again,” writes
Scott; “she has simple and apparently amiable
manners, with quick feelings.”<a id='r89'/><a href='#f89' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[89]</span></sup></a> He did see her again,
two years later, and again with Rogers, when she
showed him some notes which she induced him to
believe had been recollected and jotted down in compliance
with his suggestion on the former occasion.
This was in May 1828.<a id='r90'/><a href='#f90' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[90]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>From 1828 to 1832 she busied herself in putting
together the <span class='it'>Memoirs of Dr. Burney</span>, which appeared in
the latter year. They are based, with slight exceptions,
on her father’s own <span class='sc'>mss.</span>, drawn up in 1807 and
afterwards, and on her own unprinted diaries and
personal recollections. She herself was eighty when
they were published, and her style had not improved
with age. For the present generation, these
records have been superseded by the publication of the
original diaries and letters upon which in part they
were based; but when they were issued in 1832, their
memories and anecdotes were new to the public, who
were not so impatient of their other defects as are
later readers. Southey, indeed, to whom the volumes
were sent by the author’s son, was unreserved in his
praise. He wrote from Keswick that <span class='it'>Evelina</span> had not
<span class='pageno' title='200' id='Page_200'></span>
given him more pleasure when he was a schoolboy
than these memoirs had given him now, and that was
saying a good deal. “Except Boswell’s”—he went on—“there
is no other work in our language which carries
us into such society, and makes us fancy that we are
acquainted with the people to whom we are there
introduced.” But Croker, whom she had declined to
assist with material for his edition of Boswell, made
the <span class='it'>Memoirs</span> the subject of malignant attack in the
<span class='it'>Quarterly</span> for April, 1833. Mme. D’Arblay—we are
given to understand—was seriously pained by the
imputation of unveracity contained in this article; and
she might well be hurt on other grounds. The
duties of reviewers are not always pleasant to perform;
and Croker might plead, in defence of his
ungallant inquisition into the author’s age, that, like
Rousseau, he was simply actuated by the love of
truth; but to say of a blameless and inoffensive old
lady of eighty, who might certainly claim indulgence
for imperfect recollection, that her style could not
have been “more feeble, anile, incoherent, or ‘<span class='it'>sentant
plus l’apoplexie</span>,’ ” is surely to write oneself down both
cruel and contemptible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the rare references to Mme. D’Arblay at this
date is contained in Disraeli’s letters to his sister.
“<span class='it'>Contarini</span>,” he writes, “seems universally liked, but
moves slowly. The staunchest admirer I have in
London, and the most discerning appreciator of <span class='it'>Contarini</span>,
is old Madame D’Arblay. I have a long letter,
which I will show you,—capital!” This was written
in July, 1832. In 1837 Mme. D’Arblay had the misfortune
to lose her son. Since she had placed him
at Cambridge in 1813, he had done well. He had
<span class='pageno' title='201' id='Page_201'></span>
graduated in 1818 as tenth Wrangler; and though
handicapped by a French education, became a Fellow
of his College (Christ’s). Having taken orders in 1819,
he was made, in 1836, minister of Ely Chapel, Holborn.
He was preparing to marry, when he succumbed
suddenly to influenza in January, 1837. His mother
did not long survive him. Two years later, she was
attacked by an illness, which was accompanied by
spectral illusions; and, on January 6, 1840, being then
in her eighty-eighth year, she died, at Lower Grosvenor
Street, New Bond Street, and was buried by the side
of her husband and son at Walcot. The prettiest
story of her last days is told by Rogers. It is <span class='it'>à propos</span>
of the well-known lines which begin—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<div class='literal-container' style=''><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“Life! we’ve been long together”;</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>and end—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<div class='literal-container' style=''><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line0'>“Say not Good Night, but in some brighter clime</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Bid me Good Morning.”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='noindent'>“Sitting with Madame D’Arblay some time before she
died, I [Rogers] said to her, ‘Do you remember those
lines of Mrs. Barbauld’s <span class='it'>Life</span>, which I once repeated to
you?’ ‘Remember them,’ she replied; ‘I repeat them
to myself every night before I go to sleep.’ ”<a id='r91'/><a href='#f91' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[91]</span></sup></a></p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>In 1842, two years after Mme. D’Arblay’s death,
the first five volumes of her <span class='it'>Diary and Letters</span> were
issued. These, like the <span class='it'>Memoirs of Dr. Burney</span>, were
savagely assailed by Croker in the <span class='it'>Quarterly</span> in an
article which had the good fortune to provoke a
masterly retort in the <span class='it'>Edinburgh</span> from Lord Macaulay.
Modern research has rectified some of the minor details,
<span class='pageno' title='202' id='Page_202'></span>
and modern criticism may dissent from some
of the deductions, in this famous counterblast. But
though no doubt prompted by antagonism to Mme.
D’Arblay’s assailant in the rival review, and though
strongly coloured by the writer’s political opinions, it
remains, and must remain, a memorable tribute to the
author of <span class='it'>Evelina</span> and <span class='it'>Cecilia</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Lord Macaulay’s essay, indeed, and to its
periodical reproduction in fresh editions of his works,
is probably due most of Mme. D’Arblay’s existing
reputation as a novelist. And that reputation rests
almost exclusively upon her first two productions,
<span class='it'>Evelina</span> and <span class='it'>Cecilia</span>. We doubt if the piety of the
enthusiast could ever revive—or rather create—the
slightest interest in <span class='it'>The Wanderer</span>; or that any but the
fanatics of the out-of-date, or the student of manners,
could conscientiously struggle through <span class='it'>Camilla</span>. Works
of genius, it is true, are occasionally born out of due
time, and consequently fail of the recognition they
deserve from their contemporaries, only to attain it
eventually either through the insight of the independent
critic, or the better knowledge of after ages.
But these were not the circumstances of <span class='it'>Camilla</span> and
<span class='it'>The Wanderer</span>. Both books were circulated freely
among an audience not only specially qualified to
judge, but also specially well-disposed; and if, with
these advantages, they could not succeed in obtaining
approbation, it is idle to attempt to revive them now.
With <span class='it'>Cecilia</span> and <span class='it'>Evelina</span>, the case is different. They
stand on their merits. And their merits are undeniable.
It is true that—as Walpole said—<span class='it'>Cecilia</span> is too
long; but its crowd of characters is very skilfully
varied, and many of them, as Briggs, Albany, Mr.
<span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span>
Delville, Mrs. Harrel, Mr. Monckton, are drawn with
marked ability. And though the book has less freshness
than its predecessor, it has more constructive
power and greater certainty of hand. Mme. D’Arblay’s
masterpiece, however, is <span class='it'>Evelina</span>. This she wrote
because she must,—neither preoccupied with her public
nor her past;<a id='r92'/><a href='#f92' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[92]</span></sup></a>—and throughout this book penned for
amusement in Newton’s old observatory, one never
catches, as in <span class='it'>Cecilia</span>, the creak of the machinery, or
fancies, in the background, the paternal voice pressing
for prompt publication. It is perhaps difficult for a
modern reader to be impressed by the sentiments of
the excellent Mr. Villars, still less to “blubber,” like
Dr. Burney, over Sir John Belmont’s heroics; but, in
spite of youthful exaggerations and faults of taste, it
is still possible to admire the vivacity with which Miss
Anville narrates her experiences, embarrassments, and
social trepidations. It is also possible to comprehend
something of the unparalleled enthusiasm produced by
the opportune appearance of Evelina’s history in a
dead season of letters—by its freedom from taint of
immorality, its unfeigned fun and humour, and its
unhackneyed descriptions of humanity. One can easily
conceive how welcome these latter characteristics
must have been to a public sickened and depressed by
the “inflammatory tales” and “sentimental frippery”<a id='r93'/><a href='#f93' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[93]</span></sup></a>
of the circulating libraries. <span class='it'>Evelina</span>, moreover, marks
<span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span>
a definite deviation in the progress of the national
fiction. Leaving Fielding’s breezy and bustling highway,
leaving the analytic hothouse of Richardson, it
carries the novel of manners into domestic life, and prepares
the way for Miss Edgeworth and the exquisite
parlour-pieces of Miss Austen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the <span class='it'>Memoirs of Dr. Burney</span>, it is not necessary to
say much more than has already been said. Although,
as we have seen, Southey could praise them warmly,—to
be sure, he was acknowledging a complimentary
copy,—Macaulay declares that they were received with
“a cry of disgust,” which a later writer converts into
“a scream of derision.” Yet is must nevertheless be
admitted that they contain much in the way of letters,
documents, and anecdote which the student cannot
well neglect; and it should be observed that it is in
the connecting passages that the writer’s “peculiar
rhetoric” is most manifest. The curious expedients
she adopts to avoid using the personal pronoun; and
the catenated phrases to which Croker objected, and
which he unkindly emphasised by hyphens (<span class='it'>e.g.</span> “the
yet very handsome though no longer in her bloom,
Mrs. Stephen Allen,” “the sudden, at the moment,
though from lingering illnesses often previously expected
death, of Mrs. Burney”),—are certainly amusing;
as is also the nebulous magniloquence of passages
like the following, not, it may be added, an exceptional
specimen:—“This sharp infliction, however, though
it ill recompensed his ethereal flight, by no means
checked his literary ambition; and the ardour which
was cooled for gazing at the stars, soon seemed doubly
re-animated for the music of the spheres.” But what
is more extraordinary than these utterances is, that
<span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span>
Mme. D’Arblay seems herself to have had no suspicion
of their extravagance, since we find her, even
after the publication of <span class='it'>The Wanderer</span>, gravely enjoining
her son to avoid overstrained expression, not to
labour to embellish his thoughts, and above all, to “be
natural.”<a id='r94'/><a href='#f94' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[94]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>Happily for her readers, the <span class='it'>Diary</span>—to which we
now come—is not written in the pernicious style of the
<span class='it'>Memoirs of Dr. Burney</span>. Even in those parts of it which
were composed after <span class='it'>Cecilia</span> and <span class='it'>Camilla</span>, it is still clear,
fluent, and unaffected. Now and then, perhaps,—as in
the quotation on Burke’s oratory at p. 160,—there is a
sense of effort; but in general, the manner is delightful.
Why Macaulay, who praised the <span class='it'>Diary</span> so much, did
not praise it more,—did not, in fact, place it high
above Mme. D’Arblay’s efforts as a novelist,—is hard to
comprehend. It has all the graphic picturesqueness,
all the dramatic interest, all the objective characterisation,
all the happy faculty of “making her descriptions
alive” (as “Daddy” Crisp had said),—which
constitute the charm of the best passages in <span class='it'>Evelina</span>.
But it has the further advantage that it is true;
and that it deals with real people. King George
and Queen Charlotte, Mrs. Schwellenberg and M.
de Guiffardière, Johnson and Reynolds, Burke and
Garrick, Sheridan, Cumberland, Mrs. Thrale, Mrs.
Delany, Omai and Count Orloff—stand before us in
their habits as they lived, and we know them more
intimately than Mr. Briggs, believe in them more
implicitly than in Captain Mirvan, and laugh at them
more honestly than at “Madam French.” The <span class='it'>Diary</span> of
Mme. D’Arblay deserves to rank with the great diaries
<span class='pageno' title='206' id='Page_206'></span>
of literature. It is nothing that it is egotistical, for
egotism is of its essence: it is nothing that it is minute,
its minuteness enforces the impression. It gives us
a gallery of portraits which speak and move; and a
picture of society which we recognise as substantially
true to life.</p>
